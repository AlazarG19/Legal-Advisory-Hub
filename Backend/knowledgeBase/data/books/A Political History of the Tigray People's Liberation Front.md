Introduction
Background to the study
This book is a study of the origins and evolution of an Ethiopian insurgent movement, the
Tigray People’s Liberation Front, that emerged some 34 years ago and has determined
much of contemporary Ethiopia’s political development. The study is primarily a
narrative political and military history but also intends to address general sociological
issues of ethnic-based inequality, political conflict, social mobilization and revolutionary
armed resistance in a developing country. In this Introduction I outline the main issues of
the study and present arguments for the relevance of the extended case study for an
understanding of conditions for armed rebellion in Africa and of recent Ethiopian
political history in particular.
The evolution of the Ethiopian state, one of the oldest in the world, was
historically marked by the interaction of ethnic, regional and religious factors that at
times acted in harmony and at other times in conflict (Belai Giday 1983 E.C.1; Markakis
1990; Marcus 1994). Interwoven as they were, one of these aspects of interaction was
prevalent at one time and the other at another time. Latent or openly, ethnicity or ethnic
identification has played a major role in the contestation and conflict over who runs the
state. In present-day, multiethnic Ethiopia too, both ‘ethnic politics’ and ethnic
mobilization in covert and manifest forms served as pathways to power and as the pillars
that sustained it. The roots of this political process can be traced at least from the so-
called ‘Era of Princes’ (or Zemene Mesafint, from 1769 to 1855), when Ethiopia was
‘decentralized’ or parcelled out in a disorderly fashion among local contending princes

Gregorian one.
1and lords who drew support from their ethno-regional, ethnic or sub-ethnic social bases.2
Since then, ethnic referents have been important in forming the power base of Ethiopian
political elites, and national integration has remained a highly contentious issue. Some
historians (Bahru Zewde 1991; Teshale Tibebu 1995) argue that regionalism instead of
ethnicity was the main feature upon which power was constructed in Ethiopia; however,
it is the contention of this study that ethnicity in its latent or unveiled form was no less
crucial, if not more important, as a factor in the power equation and the formation of state
politics in Ethiopia, especially so when one observes the alignments of forces in the last
four decades and the prevalence of ‘ethnic politics’ at present.
In the past century neither the ‘national integration policy’ of Emperor Haile
Selassie (r. 1930-1974) nor the ‘Ethiopia First’ motto of the military Dergue regime
(1974-1991), which hybridized Ethiopian nationalism with Marxism, helped stem the
rising tide of ethno-nationalist rebellion. The regime of the Emperor was confronted by
ethno-national and regional armed movements in Tigrai (1942-43), Bale (1963-68),
Gojjam (1967) and Eritrea since early 1960s. While he managed to successfully suppress
the first three, the Eritrean movement was intractable – mainly due to the external support
that the others were not able to acquire. The Dergue too had to encounter another wave of
ethno-national movements, some of them ‘inherited’ from the era of the previous regime
and that ultimately brought its demise in 1991. Both these regimes collapsed in the face
of the sustained onslaught of primarily ethnic-based national liberation movements and to
a certain extent of forces of change at the centre. One of the ethno-nationalist movements
which spearheaded the revolt against the military regime from 1975 to 1991 was the
Tigrai People’s Liberation Front (TPLF), the subject-matter of this study.3
2 Although ethno-regional alignments blended into the power politics of the Ethiopian state dating
back at least to the Zemene Mesafint/Era of Princes (1769-1855), it was only under the EPRDF
regime that the restructuring of the state on ethnic basis took a legally and officially recognized
form for the first time.
3 Research studies on the TPLF especially by insiders are rare. Kahsay Berhe (whose second
name coincides with that of the present author but is not related) is the only insider so far who
published a book on the role of the TPLF in the political struggles in Ethiopia. Also several
unpublished critical papers were produced by Tesfay Atsbaha & Kahsay Berhe, Giday Zeratsion,
Asgede Gebreselassie, and the present author. There also few studies by outsiders, like researcher
2The TPLF started its struggle to ensure ‘self-determination’ for the region of
Tigrai within the Ethiopian polity. It embarked on its armed struggle with a hybrid
ideology4 that mingled ethno-nationalism with Marxism. Its Marxism was of a different
variant from that of the Dergue. Ethnicity was the prime mobilizing factor of the people
of Tigrai, while Marxism served as an ideological tool of organizational and policy
matters as well as to attract other ‘oppressed social classes’ outside of Tigrai. ‘Self-
determination’ for every ethno-national group in Ethiopia was also upheld as a motto that
in turn attracted various marginalized groups, some of which finally joined the TPLF to
forge the Ethiopian People Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) in its final march
to power in 1991. The initial junior partners of the TPLF in forging the EPRDF were the
Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement (EPDM), which later changed its name to
Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM),5 and the Oromo People’s Democratic
Organization (OPDO), ostensibly representing the Amhara and Oromo ethnic groups
(peoples) respectively.
The TPLF thus could claim success, especially over the discredited military
regime of Colonel Mengistu Haile-Mariam and a number of other opponents which were
either ethnic or multi-ethnic political organizations. Although previously there had been a
number of ethno-nationalist movements of one form or the other that rose up to challenge
the Ethiopian state, none of them were able to break the backbone of the central state. In
1991 after waging a sixteen years’ protracted war, the ethno-nationalist TPLF finally
managed to conquer Ethiopian state power, with a host of local and external factors
contributing to its success.
John Young, who wrote the first academic work on the TPLF (1997) and Jenny Hammond, a
former literature teacher at Oxford Brookes University, with an account strongly sympathizing
with the TPLF. Both will be touched upon in subsequent chapters.

1977 E.C., ‘Constitution of the MLLT’, Hamle 1977 E.C. and ‘May Day’, MLLT Internal Organ,
1986, year 1, no. 3.
5 According to, among others, former EPDM members (e.g., Yared Tibebu 2003), it was the
pressure of the TPLF that forced the former multi-national EPDM to change its name and
program into an ‘ethnic’ organization, the ANDM.
3With the seizure of power by an ethno-nationalist force, one might assume that in
post-1991 Ethiopia ethnic-based conflicts would have a better chance of being resolved.
Yet after almost two decades of controversies and experimentation, ethnic-based conflicts
have not gone away but grown into new forms, and, according to some, to an
unprecedented level. The realization of democratic governance and self-determination for
Tigrai or the rest of the Ethiopian ethno-nationalities, for that matter, remains a moot
point. As Solomon Gashaw (1993: 156) already put it as early as 1993, ‘… the EPRDF is
already encountering resistance by various groups – ethnic groups such as the Oromo
have openly challenged that the EPRDF is simply a Tigraian front’. Even before 1993, as
many as nineteen ethno-nationalist organizations were created and legally registered to
challenge the EPRDF (see Appendix 1). The number of the unregistered ethnic
organizations probably even went beyond that. The new state policy did not take long to
have effects, both negative and positive. Abbink observed: ‘The ‘ethnic policy’ pursued –
including the cantonization of the country into ‘ethnic zones’ – has led to a new discourse
of division and opposition, when people are being classified in terms of their presumed
ethnic group, or are stimulated to follow the directives of an imagined primordial
identity’ (1995: 71). Clapham noted that: ‘Any insurgency, dependent on mobilizing
local-level support, almost necessarily must articulate concepts of identity which bind
together its supporters and distinguish them from their adversaries. In Ethiopia, the TPLF
and subsequently the EPRDF explicitly articulated an idea of ‘nationality’ which formed
the basis for a state structure built on the principles of ethnic federalism’ (1998: 13). Yet,
ethnic conflicts are still looming even after the prevalence of the ethno-nationalist TPLF
over the Ethiopian state, suggesting the need for an in-depth historical study of the TPLF,
including its ideology, forms of struggle, means of mobilization and political objectives
that shaped its present standing in the Ethiopian power politics.
Main Tenets of the Study
This study departs from a number of themes that can be summarized as follows.
4The historical question
Historically, the TPLF traced the origin of its struggle back to the popular uprising of
1942 - 43, called the ‘Woyyane’, that was crushed by the forces of the imperial state
backed by the British air force, although at that time the demand was ‘legitimate regional
autonomy’, which may be regarded as one form of self-determination or decentralization.
As the state, in subsequent years, pursued a heavy-handed administration in Tigrai with
the aim of quashing any potential rebellion rather than opting for a peaceful and
democratic handling of local demands, anger and frustration of the population increased.
Ted Gurr’s words (1970: 354) asserted that: ‘Violence inspires counter-violence by those
against whom it is directed’ were confirmed in Tigrai at the time. After 1943, the people
kept on invoking the history of Woyyane, reminiscent of their struggle against injustice.
Munck (2000) was to the point when he noted that ‘…with a long-term view it is clear
that regimes which refuse to recognize a legitimate interlocutor may only postpone the
inevitable, with the ensuing years of accumulated bitterness and distrust making a
democratic settlement that much more difficult and fragile’ (2000: 11). Finally, calling it
the Kalai Woyyane (‘second Woyyane’), the TPLF appeared to reinvigorate that struggle
in the form of national self-determination against an oppressive state. As Abbink put it
‘[o]ften an ethnic revival is primarily a result of failing state policy…’ (1997:160), and
this clearly appeared to be the case in Ethiopia. The cause of the struggle for self-
determination found adequate justification in the eyes of many disgruntled Ethiopians,
including Tigraians.
Radical ideology
The main ideological source of inspiration for TPLF’s ethno-nationalist drive was,
however, none other than Stalin’s theory on ‘the national question’, influential in the
Leftist-Marxist thinking among the opposition movements of the time. One should not
forget the origin of organizations like the TPLF in Leftist students’ movements, which
were charmed by these abstract ideas. The TPLF’s departure point was Stalin’s definition
of a nation as ‘a historically evolved, stable community of language, and territory,
5economic life and psychological makeup manifested in a community of culture’ (1942:
12). Based on this definition, it was believed that Tigrai constituted a nation which had
the right to self-determination. ‘The right to self-determination means that only the nation
itself has the right to determine its destiny, that no one has the right forcibly to interfere
in the life of the nation, … to violate its habits and customs, to repress its language, or
curtail its rights’ (ibid.: 22-23). Furthermore, if the rights of a given nation are curtailed,
Stalin propounded ‘a nation has the right to arrange its life on autonomous lines. It even
has the right to secede’ (1975: 61-62). So far, Stalin sounded a devout nationalist, and so
was the TPLF, especially in bringing the issue to the people it claimed to liberate – the
Tigraians. In contextualizing the right of self-determination up to secession, Lenin had
asserted that ‘the several demands of democracy, including self-determination, are not an
absolute, but only a small part of the general democratic (now: general socialist) world
movement. In individual concrete cases, the part may contradict the whole; if so it must
be rejected’ (1971: 132). And Stalin reasserted that: ‘[T]he Bolsheviks never separated
the national question from the general question of revolution…. The main essence of the
Bolshevik approach to the national question is that the Bolsheviks always examined the
national question in inseparable connection with the revolutionary perspective’ (op. cit.:
295). Hinging on both approaches of the national question for self-determination, the
TPLF mobilized the Tigrai people, created a strong guerrilla army and cleared its way to
eventually assume power in Ethiopia.
Although to mainstream Marxists ethnicity was thought to ‘wither away’ with the
emergence of a class-conscious, worldwide industrial proletariat, the TPLF, nevertheless,
since its inception attempted to homogenize both the ethnic and the class ideologies for
the entire duration of its struggle. It was a daunting task or simply a loss of direction for
the TPLF to combine these apparently mutually exclusive ideologies and wage a dual
struggle. In recent years, after its rise to power in 1991, the TPLF seems to close the
pages of its Marxist books and have bent towards ethnic politics; yet its declaration of
6‘Revolutionary Democracy’ (EPRDF, 2000)6 as a fresh policy guideline yields much
uncertainty in determining where the TPLF exactly is heading. As for its ethno-
nationalist stance, the TPLF demonstratively appears to be persistent and even proudly
talking of the ethnic experiment it is conducting. This double-edged theory has been an
important tool in enabling the TPLF to bridge the gap between the Marxist-Leninist
ideology that necessarily emphasized class struggle encompassing the whole of Ethiopia,
and the ethno-national demand of the struggle that focused on Tigrai, the harmonization
of which is, however, problematic.
Problems of secession in a multi-ethnic state
With the commencement of the insurgent movement under the TPLF, the idea of national
self-determination was understood to mean autonomy or self-rule for the region of Tigrai
in a would-be democratic, poly-ethnic Ethiopia. Later, in the early days of the struggle,
self-determination was stretched by an ultra-nationalist group within the emerging TPLF,
to mean secession from the Ethiopian nation-state, with the aim of establishing an
‘independent republic of Tigrai’, as declared by the 1976 ‘TPLF Manifesto’.7 The
justification for this secessionist stance was drawn eclectically from the theoretical
formulations of Stalin on self-determination. There were no other historical, legal or
political provisions that substantiated the arguments for secession. This idea of secession
was contemplated only by a section of the leadership that with Eriksen’s term (1993)
might be called ‘ethnic entrepreneurs’ and not by the rank and file or the people of Tigrai,
who constituted one of the main historic cores of the Ethiopian polity. This extreme
position was one source of subsequent divisions in the organization.
In 1978, the secession option was proclaimed to have been dropped, after pressure
mounted from an internal opposition and also from other Ethiopians and friends of
6 See EPRDF, ‘The Development Lines of Revolutionary Democracy’ Addis Ababa, 1992 E.C.
[2000].
7 This was the first published program of the TPLF, also known as Manifesto-68. ‘68’ indicates
the year the Manifesto was published in the Ethiopian Calendar (E.C.). For further details, see
also chapter 5.
7Ethiopia, who saw no merit in secession. Ironically, external pressure, particularly from
the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front (EPLF), had also a significant role in the
denunciation of secession as a program of the TPLF. Given the fluidity of ethnicity and
the divergent analytical approaches it developed, the TPLF as an ethno-nationalist force
appears to have eclectically theorized and pragmatically acted as far as the ‘national self-
determination’ of Tigrai was concerned. Especially, when one looks into how class
analysis and the strategy of class struggle was blended into the ethno-nationalist
movement of the TPLF until the early 1990s, the current political turmoil within the
TPLF and the worsening insecurity and perhaps crisis of the Ethiopian state are perhaps
no surprise. The TPLF embarking on self-determination for the people of Tigrai was, at
the same time, engaged, or pretended to be engaged, in class struggle that encompassed
all oppressed classes in Ethiopia. Yet, it fell short of creating the power base for the latter
by focusing on the former objective, self-determination of Tigrai.
In the history of Ethiopia, no government other than that led by the TPLF since
1991 stretched ethno-nationalism to such a far-reaching point, although ethno-national
challenges steadily trailed the evolution of the modern Ethiopian state. Constitutionally
the post-1991 government granted the right to ethnic nationalities to secede and become
independent states (ref. article 39.1 of the 1994 Constitution). Evidently, the relationship
of the numerous ethnic groups in Ethiopia has entered a new but turbulent phase, which
looks difficult to manage indeed. As far as the point of ethnicity and politics is
concerned, as Abbink observes, ‘[T]here is no going back to a unitary state structure in
Ethiopia which denies ethno-regional differences and rights, or which lets one group
dominate the state’ (1997: 174), although ‘the history of Ethiopia … is most obviously
the history of a state, and the story that it tells recounts the ups and downs of what is
assumed to be a broadly continuous political organization’ (Clapham, 2002: 38). ‘The
implication is that’, as Doornbos expounds, ‘… basic political identifications are
generally not with the state but with sub-national units, such as linguistic, ethnic,
religious, racial or regional collectivities’ (1978: 170). Thus, the restructuring of the
8Ethiopian state in a way to create more stable and harmonious relationships among the
multitude of ethnic groups becomes very difficult.
The practical application of ethnic identity in various fields of the struggle for
national self-determination continued to manifest the diversity of interpretations, inherent
in the elasticity of concept itself and in the differing perceptions and inclinations of the
TPLF leaders at all levels. In this regard, the issue of secession continues to challenge the
stability of the Ethiopian state and the political elite at the top.
The link between elite ideology and mass movement
The explanations for the strength and weakness of the TPLF in mobilizing the people of
Tigrai and building an army to wage a protracted war against the military regime of
Colonel Mengistu Haile-Mariam and finally its success in conquering state power in 1991
are to be found in the specific and perhaps timely ideological blend of ethno-nationalism
on the one hand and the Front’s Stalinist rhetoric on the other. The systematic application
of both ideologies in drawing the populace into the political battle seemed to have
worked to the intended purpose. Colburn (1994: 16) noted that: ‘The goals of this
generation’s revolutionaries have been elusive, but their scope and exhaustive pursuit
drained their citizens materially and emotionally’. Despite this latter point, most of the
local population was persuaded and/or coerced to focus on the project of the Front, i.e. to
win the war and seize power.
Beginning the late 1970s, an ultra-left ideological brand of Marxism–Leninism
(Stalinism specifically) was gaining ground inside the Front and culminated in the
formation of a party called the Marxist-Leninist League of Tigrai (MLLT) in 1985. This
vanguard party, as was the fashion in authoritarian fronts and regimes, came to control
every activity of the people under its sphere of action. Although the MLLT nowadays
seems to be out of sight, the ideology it extolled served as a lens and compass to guide
and control the movement. This feature will lead us to investigate the theoretical
departure point(s) of the TPLF and also to give due consideration to key concepts and
theories of ethnicity, nationalism, class struggle, and self-determination – concepts
9extensively utilized by the TPLF to create a broad-based mass movement both during the
struggle and after the seizure of power. The intention, however, is not to discuss the
concepts at length; rather, it is to emphasize their relevance to the retrospective analysis
of the struggle and how they helped TPLF’s ascent to power.
Research Questions
The main research question that directed this study is why and how the Tigraian
nationalist movement emerged, evolved and prevailed, how it successfully mobilized a
critical mass of people behind it, and what the role was of the political elite vis-à-vis the
masses during and after the struggle? The focus will be on the political sociology of mass
resistance, revolutionary elite formation and transformative armed struggle on the basis
of a popularly shared agenda, in Gurr’s words (1970), on ‘why men rebel’ and on how
they win.
To address the main research issue adequately, however, a set of pertinent sub-questions
will be raised throughout the text, some of which are:
a. What were the specific socio-economic and political conditions in Ethiopia that
gave rise to ethno-nationalist awareness, and why was this followed by a
movement?
b. Why did the traditional, 20th century Ethiopian state dominated by the Shewan-
Amhara ethno-regional group find itself entangled in ethnic-based conflicts?
c. Why did the state fail to resolve the ethnic and ethno-regional contradictions
prevalent in the country?
d. What was the social background that inspired the political elite that agitated
mobilized and organized the Tigraians to wage an ethno-nationalist armed
struggle?
10e. What were the aims and objectives of the revolutionary political elite vis-à-vis that
of the people on whose behalf the movement was launched? Where do they
converge or diverge?
f. How did the movement develop from a small guerrilla group to a mass-based
politico-military force that brought the state to its knees and could redefine its
national political identity?
Hypothesis
In an underdeveloped multi-ethnic society such as Ethiopia, where civil and political
rights are traditionally not institutionalized, political-economic ‘resource competition’ is
a regular feature, and collective claims are not recognized or adequately handled by the
state administration, the tendency for ethnic resistance/conflicts to emerge is high. Where
power is concentrated in the centre and in the hands of a privileged class, and basic
resources are scarce for the populace, thus causing a tenuous relationship, the political
elite of a dominant ethnic or regional group tends to manipulate ethnic antagonisms or
cleavages to remain in power, which in turn leads to forms of countervailing ethnic
resistance. As suggested, this is the case especially when economic factors enter the game
Deprived of and marginalized from fair competition with the elite of a dominant
ethnic group for power and resources, socially aspiring and rebellious elite sections of a
dominated ethnic group emerge to become a political force by mobilizing the different
social classes in the same ethno-linguistic or ethno-regional population. An ethno-
nationalist collectivity – often called ‘nationality’ - becomes an effective means of
creating a force that can challenge a state, with the aim of replacing an old system of
governance and relationships by a new one.
Self-determination as a group right goes hand in hand with ideas and aspirations of
‘democracy’, and when democracy is attained it entails an inclusive arrangement and
relationships of different groups for broader (redistributive) advantages, whereas when
the option of secession (physical separation or withdrawal) comes into play, it is
11exclusionist and does not necessarily entail democracy. Democracy is taken to mean here
representative, elected government, rule of law, a parliamentary system with free activity
of political parties, and an independent judiciary.
‘Ethnic pluralism’ is not necessarily in opposition to political pluralism. What
basically makes it conflict-ridden is the manipulation of ethnic dissensions by elites
competing for political power. Hence, the greater the inter-elite competition for power,
the greater the chances for ethnic polarization, that in most cases - and particularly in
Ethiopia - is accompanied by ethno-regional or ethnic-styled conflict. Understanding
ethnic nationalism and seeking institutional-political solutions to ‘ethnic’ conflicts at the
grassroots level before they become the issue of armed confrontation can, however,
significantly reduce the tendency and ability of political elites to manipulate ethnic
cleavages, and concomitantly dilute the influence of external powers over these elites and
thus result in greater opportunities for democratization and political stability.
Objectives of the Research
By way of a detailed, retrospective analysis of the TPLF-led armed struggle for national
self-determination, this study endeavours to:
(a) Explore the root causes of the ethno-nationalist movement in Tigrai within the
context of the socio-historical formation of the Ethiopian state and the manner in
which those who ran the state regulated ethnic-based claims. In this regard, the
study will aim to elicit the complex nature of ethnic nationalism and the ensuing
conflicts in Ethiopia both historically and in its contemporary setting, via in-depth
description.
(b) Analyze the specific socio-political factors that prompted the formation of the
TPLF which led the peasant-based rebellion up to the end of conquering power,
the concrete conditions of the peasantry itself that were the bedrock of the revolt,
and show the interplay of external forces in this political process.
12(c) Investigate the extent to which the power of ethnicity and ethnic mobilization can
derange a long established state like Ethiopia. The role of the revolutionary elite of
the TPLF in mobilizing the peasantry and all the mechanisms it adopted to create a
strong peasant force that could support a revolutionary army will be critically
scrutinized.
(d) Examine whether the anticipated goals of the ethno-nationalist revolt were clear to
all participants, and/or were achievable from the perspectives of the revolutionary
elite that led the struggle on the one hand and the peasantry that bore the heavy
brunt of the struggle on the other.
(e) Finally, reflect on the ethnically charged state formation of the ruling
TPLF/EPRDF and its implications for the relationship of the various ethno-
nationalist groups and the stability of the Ethiopian state.
Methodology
The study of the ethno-nationalist movement in Tigrai is important in that it attempts to
identify and analyze the causes, conditions of emergence and development of the
Tigraian ethno-national movement in a historical perspective, besides contributing to the
understanding of prevailing political developments in contemporary world politics as
they affect Africa.
The methodology of this research project was informed by a multi-disciplinary
approach. It depends heavily on the use and evaluation of existing political and
anthropological theories of ethnicity, ethno-nationalism, and self-determination as related
to the problematic of conflict management and democratization in multi-ethnic and
divided societies, and of course in Ethiopia in particular. For analytical and
methodological purposes, I focus on the relations and interplay between ethno-nationalist
and multi-nationalist forces on the one hand and the state-society relations on the other;
as well as on how ethnic nationalism can accelerate, stabilize or retard the processes of
democratization and nation-building in Ethiopia.
13Although ethno-nationalism has been primarily shaping the social and political
dynamics of Ethiopia, the wider regional setting and international geopolitical factors
also played a significant role. Based upon this approach, this project took the following
points of departure:
a. Considering thematic and conceptual problems related to ethnicity, ethno-
nationalism and the quest for self-determination and democracy, there will be a
discussion on the theoretical significance given to the potency of ethno-
nationalism and its actual and potential role, both in defining political
configurations as well as the political system of Ethiopia.
b. It will take into account the raison d’être of ethnic nationalism in modern Ethiopia
both historically and in its contemporary setting, which consequently established
the dominance of one particular ethno-regional group and hence the counter-
hegemonic ethno-nationalism of the dominated ethnic groups.
c. Attention will be given to the relation between ethno-nationalism and the drive for
power and resource control by various political elites. This could mean the
creation of federal structure and ethnic-based autonomous regions or even
formation of separate mini-states (seceding entities) as is the case in Ethiopia.
d. In exploring the relationship between the political elite that formulate the ethno-
nationalist venture and provide the leadership for the movement and the people
who had reasons to respond and pay the necessary sacrifice for the struggle, a
comparative survey with other movements of the same era will be useful to deeply
understand how and why they behave and act in one way or the other. Ideology,
leadership and mobilization which are important basis for ‘movement hegemony’
will be considered in the comparative study.
A substantial body of theoretical and empirical studies on ethnic nationalism and political
pluralism exists, and a selective use of these materials has been invaluable for this study.
The review of the secondary literature and the resulting analysis (see Chapter 2 for more
details) were intended to shed light on current theoretical understandings in juxtaposition
14with empirical realities. The methods of data collection included studying historical
reports of ethnic revolts – like those from the Public Record Office of the British Foreign
Department –, study of political pamphlets and documents produced by the TPLF
movement, and interviews with participants in the ethnic or multi-ethnic movements in
Ethiopia in the events described. Experiential narratives, which include autobiographical
anecdotes pertaining to the period when I was a member of the executive committee of
the Tigrai People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) for eleven years (1975-1986), as well as my
personal observations as an actor-participant in the ongoing research endeavours to find
pathways to democratize Ethiopia, which will be mediated by the multiple sources
available, will also be used.
Relevance of the Study
The wider significance of this study may lie not only in explaining the trajectory of one
(successful) African ethno-nationalist movement, the TPLF, but also in contributing to
understand the recurring character of ethnic-based national conflicts, which are now a
worldwide phenomenon, and the role they play in destabilizing established states, notably
in Africa. This understanding will help to grasp the concrete problems that trigger such
state of conflict and lead us to infer an alternative framework that could help bring an end
to such cycles of conflicts and blood-letting. Other points as to why this study is timely
are as follows:
a. The present Ethiopian regime has demonstrated the country’s potential as a major
player in the region since 1991. Therefore, it is necessary to understand factors
that could destabilize the present balance. It could be certainly a waste if ethnic-
based civil war breaks out again as a consequence of the failure to resolve
Ethiopia’s ethno-national contradictions.
b. Given the cultural influence of civil wars and political violence that are based on
ethnic and national loyalties, it is exceedingly clear that if we are to comprehend at
least some of the complexities and nuances, then we need to focus our attention
15towards problems raised by ethnic nationalism. At present one can observe that in
the case of Ethiopia ethno-nationalism largely supersedes religious loyalties.8
c. There is no doubt external factors had a role to play in ethnic-based conflicts in
Ethiopia and the surrounding region. We need to assess if the external impact
could be utilized to play a positive role in averting civil wars and political violence
instead of contributing to prolong ethnic conflicts.
d. Events in Ethiopia not only impact upon local scenarios, they also have an impact
regionally. Thus one needs to examine whether the current political dispensation
of Ethiopia along ethnic lines generate proxy conflicts that may destabilize the
region as a whole (cf. Abbink 2003b).
e. It is a contribution towards ongoing efforts to explore the possibilities of moving
away from 20th century ‘tradition’ of ethnic and national wars in Ethiopian in
particular and the region in general.
Structure of the book
As it is the objective of this study to look into how a tiny group of ethno-nationalist
radical students developed into an organized mass-based movement that swept away one
of the largest armies in Africa and became the government of Ethiopia, both solid
empirical and historical description as well as theoretical reflection is needed.
In the next chapter, some theoretical arguments will be offered to give us a frame of
reference for our discussion on the evolution of the TPLF as an ethno-nationalist group in
contemporary Africa. This will help to explore the thinking of the radical or
‘revolutionary’ group that shaped and led the struggle of the Tigraians. Chapter 3 will
discuss and fit together the objective conditions upon which the group evolved to become
a cohesive organization to launch an armed insurrection. Chapter 4 shall explain the
8 This is with the exception of one small organization called the ‘Islamic Front for the Liberation
of Oromia’ (IFLO), which is now (in 2008) near to disappearance. It is still a moot point how the
Somali Region-based Ogaden National Liberation Front will develop.
16dramatic events of the initial year of the guerrilla movement that put the nascent front to a
test. The unexpected early confrontations with the forces of the Dergue and also the
encounter with a rival front, the ‘Tigrai Liberation Front’ (TLF), and their impact on
future engagements will be assessed here. The measures taken to mobilize the population
to support the war including the eradication of shiftas (bandits) and the armed
confrontation with other rival organizations, the EDU and the EPRP will be treated in
chapter 5. Chapter 6 takes up one of the main challenges confronting the military
government (the Dergue) i.e. how it handled the ethno-national question, one of the most
sensitive political issues in Ethiopia. The Dergue’s encounter with movements seeking
self-determination, particularly with menacingly growing TPLF, will be the main focus
of discussion. Chapter 7 looks into how the TPLF treated the central issue of self-
determination at different moments of the struggle, the interpretation and application of
which shall be discussed in light of the theoretical arguments advanced. Chapter 8 shall
look into the ultra-left party, MLLT, which emerged from within the TPLF and took
control of the whole Front. Its overt activities then and its covert activities later on and
how that impacted political events in Ethiopia will be discussed at length. In chapter 9 the
influence of the Eritrean movement on the Tigraian youth in general and the thorny
relationships with the Eritrean Fronts (the ELF and the EPLF) in particular and how they
evolved in to armed confrontations will be discussed. Chapter 10 is concerned with the
socio-political and organizational activities of the TPLF to create a power base among the
people on whose behalf the struggle was waged. Chapter 11 will discuss the final days of
the Dergue and the military and diplomatic venture of the TPLF that paved its way to
power. Chapter 12 will look into the ideological, political and military ventures of the
TPLF rolled together by way of comparison with other four African fronts of the same
era. Finally, there will be a concluding chapter that will elucidate the implications of the
TPLF’s rise to power with the emphasis on its ethnic politics vis-à-vis the inter-ethnic
and intra-ethnic relationships and the stability of the nation.

Ethnicity, Mobilization and Revolt: Theoretical Considerations
The power and fluidity of ethnicity
If ethnicity happened be an effective instrument of mobilizing people’s power that could
determine the realization of ‘self-determination’ or secession and even state re-making,
its power and adaptability needs to be sufficiently understood. Indeed, well-established
nations or even regions can be destabilized by ethnic conflicts. Despite their prevalence,
though, so far there is no consensus among social scientists and policy makers on the
nature and definition of ethnicity; yet as we see it at work it is essential to adequately
grasp its scope and meaning.
Ethnicity is a very broad and complex concept that stretches in meaning at least
between the domains of ‘primordialists’ who regard it as a ‘collective identity, so deeply
rooted in historical experience that it should properly be treated as a given in human
relations and ‘instrumentalists’ who contend that ‘ethnicity is not a historical given at all,
but in fact a highly adaptive and malleable phenomenon’ (Esman 1994: 10). Although
there are wide-ranging interpretations of ethnicity, in general it is understood as the state
of believing in and belonging to an ethno-cultural or ethno-linguistic group, which ‘may
be both an expression of primordialism and an interest group’ (Lal 1995: 431). ‘It is
manifested in all types of forms ranging from the desire to observe rites and customs of
one’s people to the demand of formation of a separate state. All depends on concrete
historical conditions’ (Ismagilova 1994: 9); in this case ethnicity ‘…describes both a set
of relations and a mode of consciousness’ (Comaroff and Comaroff 1992: 54). The set of
relations are based on real or assumed primordial links of common origin, culture,
language or physical resemblance, while the mode of consciousness can be constructed
18by a political, economic or even cultural group whose drive is to regain what was lost or
safeguard what is at hand. In this respect, ethnicity has both an emotional and material
basis, and could be manipulated in a flexible fashion. It is precisely from these elusive
attributes that ethnicity draws out its power and fluid character. In both instances,
ethnicity provides an effective uniting factor among those who feel relative deprivation, a
real or imagined threat and the need for change as opposed to those who want to maintain
the status quo. Therefore ethnicity remains a crucial phenomenon whether as a ‘social
construct’ or ‘as an artefact of human imagination and rooted in the darkest recesses of
history – fluid and manipulable yet important enough to kill for’ (Chua, 2004: 15).
Owing to its power and fluidity, ethnicity can rise to the level of ‘nationality’ – an
ethnic group that aspires peoplehood and political status - depending on the desire of the
political actors that utilize it. When ethnicity is collectively expounded to the level of an
organization that opts for political action or state formation in an existing state-society
relationship, it becomes nationalism. At this point, the intrinsic relationship between
ethnicity and nationalism becomes obvious. As Eriksen asserts, ‘…the distinction
between nationalism and ethnicity as analytical concepts is a simple one ... A nationalist
ideology is an ethnic ideology which demands a state on behalf of the ethnic group’
(1993: 118). The demand of ethno-nationalists could be for a fair share or for full control
of state power. Nonetheless, it is for this very analytical purpose that in this study the
struggle waged by the TPLF is referred as an ethno-nationalist movement. The politics of
an ethnic group, in short, yield a nationalist demand that is widely claimed by such
forces, including the TPLF, as the ‘right to self-determination’.
The fluidity of ethnicity can depend not only on how an ethnic group identifies
itself but also on how it may be identified by a certain ethno-political entrepreneurs at a
particular point in time. As Chua (2004: 14-15) states:
Ethnic identity is not static but shifting and highly malleable. In Rwanda, for
example, 14 percent Tutsi minority dominated the Hutu majority
economically and politically for four centuries, as a kind of cattle-owning
19aristocracy. But for most of this period the lines between Hutus and Tutsi
were permeable. The two groups spoke the same language, intermarriage
occurred and successful Hutus could ‘become Tutsi’. This was no longer true
after the Belgians arrived and, steeped in specious theories of racial
superiority, issued ethnic identity cards on the basis of nose length and
cranial circumstances.
In this manner, ethnic awareness was raised to a different level that spurred ethnic
bloodshed and that is ‘what makes ethnic conflict so terrifyingly difficult to understand
and contain’ (Ibid: 15). Ironically, Belgium itself is at present (in 2008) facing a non-
violent but serious ethno-linguistic divide of its own between the Flemish and Walloon
communities – a situation that has paralyzed the government for a year now.
‘Ethnicity’ is not a scientifically determinable status, argue Horowitz (1985) and
Chua (2004), . Indeed social scientists conceptualize ethnicity differently. Therefore we
are confronted with a very broad domain for the definition of ethnicity that encompasses
differences along racial lines (for example, blacks and whites in the United States), lines
of geographic origin (for example, Malays, Chinese, and Indians in Malaysia), as well as
linguistic, religious, tribal, or other cultural lines (for example, Kikuyu and Kalenjin
tribes in Kenya or Jews and Muslims in the Middle East) (Chua, 2004: 14), or the Afar,
Agew, Tigrai, Amhara, Oromo, Sidama, Gambella, Gurage and other ethnic groups in
Ethiopia.
In a more practical sense, Markakis asserts that ‘[e]thnicity has long been one of
the factors determining political choice in Africa; as it has been in many parts of the
globe. Given the nature of African societies, it would have been strange indeed, if this
were not so’ (1996: 300). Furthermore, Horowitz argues: ‘Ethnic affiliation provides a
sense of security in a divided society, as well as a source of trust, certainty, reciprocal
help, and protection against neglect of one’s interest by strangers’ (1994: 49). Fitting in
this line of though, Mohamed Salih adds following the discussion on Anderson’s
imagined community (1983): ‘…unless ethnicity is taken seriously, Africa’s struggle to
20democratize the state and development will suffer no better a fate than that of an
imagined nation state’ (2001: 25). Also Merera (2002: 25) seems to share this thinking
when he writes: ‘Mohamed Salih’s position of fully condoning ethnicity as a positive
social force in Africa, although rare in academic discourse, is relevant to our discussion
on Ethiopia, where ethnicity has already become an ‘official’ state ideology and practice’.
This line of discourse is well taken by the elites of the TPLF to justify the need for the
restructuring of the Ethiopian state and the redefinition of the relationship of the multiple
ethno-national groups which is not settled yet after almost two decades of rigorous
experimentation. The problem of such approach, however, is that it is short of addressing
the domino effect that could be generated by sub-ethnic groups within the ethnic entity
that achieved the envisaged status. In Ethiopia many sub-ethnic groups are being
mobilized to demand ‘self-determination’ the limits of which may reach secession and
are also fighting among each other over scarce resources, territory and power (Dereje
Feyissa 2006; Abbink 2006).
In all these cases, ethnicity seems to occupy centre stage in the stated quest for
societal reform, stability, democracy and development. As the above-stated views may
generate a lot of argument, just for the purpose of the comparison of the diverse positions
and to demonstrate the problems compounding the comprehension of ethnicity, we
consider some other social scientists’ alternative views.
‘The study of ethnic phenomena reveals’, Roosens argues, ‘how far ethnic
ideology and historical reality can diverge from each other; how much people feel things
that are not there and conveniently forget realities that have existed’ (1989: 161). In its
application for political organizations, Doornbos elaborates, ‘if ethnicity is to be assigned
any paramount constitutional role in this scheme of things, renewed disillusionments will
be difficult to avoid: ethnicity can only provide an alternative basis for political
organization at the cost of a whole new wave of misrepresentations, distortions and
inequalities’ (1998: 29). Such feelings, as observed in many places, could be
expeditiously transformed into violent acts of responses to daily suffocating realities.
Thus Gurr (1970: 36) noted: ‘It is true, and the frustration-aggression relationship is
21significant for political violence, to the extent that actors in political violence manifest or
admit to some degree of anger’. In these circumstances people are overtaken by group
mentality even at the expense of rational thoughts, revealing that ‘[c]ollective human
memories and attention spans tend to be quite ephemeral, and as news coverage flits from
one crisis to another, processes of forgetting take place almost unconsciously’ (de Silva
2000: 248). Furthermore, Alter contends that: ‘Nationalism, to all intents and purposes,
means undisguised political egoism. As an ideology it preaches solidarity with and
willingness to make sacrifice to one particular social group’ (1994: 118) and ‘[t]he other
is seen as a knife in the throat of the nation’, Keane adds (1995: 193).
Despite the conflicting views on ethnicity and its uses, the main issue, however, is
that such divergent views do not remain analytical tools or theoretical postulates and
positions confined to the social scientists or the politicians concerned. Those well-
articulated views, divergent as they are in their interpretations and objectives, often find
ground to influence millions of people to the one side or the other and guide them to
some kind of action, more often to a political revolt. The consciousness and the sentiment
created as a result of these views henceforth determine the type of action the people
pursue to achieve real or imagined ends, like ‘self determination’ or secession, in many
cases in violent ways. The role of aspiring spokesmen or elites is often vital here.
Whether ethnicity - especially when politicized - has a positive or negative message, the
debate looks far from reaching a conclusive end. In the meantime, it is out there at large,
serving as a tool of mobilizing people on the one side or to meet certain perceived ends
on the other, but always in relation to ‘Others’, who are seen as standing in the way. The
power and fluidity of ethnicity is thus at the service of ethnic entrepreneurs and
marginalized social classes that seek change for the better.
Ethno-nationalism, self-determination and secession
Although ethnicity and nationalism are intrinsically related concepts and the former, with
its power and fluidity, may evolve to the latter to pursue some kind of political enterprise,
22but they are not one and the same, and have essential features that distinguish one from
the other. In brief, ‘[w]hat most clearly distinguishes nationalism from ethnicity is its
political agenda’ (Cornell and Hartman 1998: 37) and the political projection basically is
the rise of ethnicity to nationalism, hence termed ethno-nationalism. The often
tumultuous process through which ethno-nationalism evolves and the objectives it seeks
to realize are vague and shrouded in subjectivity that often causes heated discourse and/or
conflict.
It can be said that nationalism is politicized ethnicity, which means its entering
into the realm of power politics. As McAdams, Tarrow and Tilly (2001) put it,
‘[e]thnicity is a constructed claim to common origin, shared culture, and linked fate but,
unlike nationality, it affords adherents no necessary political standing and has a shifting
and nonessential relation to nationality…. Like other identities, nationality and ethnicity
refer to social relations rather than individual attributes, rest on socially organized
categories, and involve claims to collective rights-cum-obligations’ (2001: 231-232).
Thus the linkage between ethnicity and nationality and the rise of ethno-nationalism is
not without a political mission per se.
Considering the fluid nature of ethnicity, lending it the power to mobilize people
in different circumstances using concomitant historical, cultural or political issues and
symbols, similar things can be said of ethno-nationalism. Like ethnicity, there are also
divergent views compounding ethno-nationalism. With regards to the complexity and
vacillating features of ethno-nationalism, Bugajski observes that ‘[e]thnic nationalism
may be a positive or negative phenomenon: it can be aggressive or defensive, rational or
emotional, consistent or unpredictable; it has moments of intensity, period of passivity,
and it is often contradictory’ (1994: 102). On the positive side, Nabudere elaborates that
‘it tries to cope with modernity whilst also at the same time defining one’s identity for
needs of stability and self-definition’ (1999: 90), while on the negative side he goes on to
show that the ‘class manipulation and mobilization of the ethnic sentiments for purely
narrow and self-serving interests of a small minority of elites who continuously struggle
for positions in the state’ (ibid.: 90). The positive and negative attributes of ethnic
23nationalism brought up by both Bugajski and Nabudere again highlights the potential
power and fluidity of ethno-nationalism, but at the same time posses the danger of
unpredictable outcome that is related to intensified conflicts and fragmentation of a multi-
ethnic society like Ethiopia. The unpredictability of the ethno-nationalist drive was
elaborated upon by McAdams, Tarrow and Tilly (2001: 232). They argue:
‘In the case of ethnicity, claims to rights and obligations vary in degree and
type, from passing recognition of kinship all the way to legal singling out for
special treatment, negative or positive. Nationalist intellectuals, clerics,
language teachers, bureaucrats, soldiers, and rent seekers have at one time or
another hitched their wagon to an ethnic star, seeking to elevate it into a
nationality by distinguishing it from others. Others have constructed ethnicity
as the foundation for an existing state they hoped to erect in their own
images. Still others have cordially ignored it, building national identity on
criteria that emerge from common life together, on common suspicion of
neighbours, or on state made boundaries’ (2001: 232).
In general, however, it is widely understood that ethno-nationalist consciousness and
movement aims at achieving a ‘right to self-determination’ of the people within the
specific ethnic nationality that may or may not culminate in secession. But given the
contradictory perceptions of ethno-nationalism, as noted above, one is inclined to ask
what exactly is the ‘right to self-determination’, and why does it include ‘secession’ as
one of its final aims? Does secession bring about the democratic right that triggered the
demand for the right to self-determination in the first place? The internationally
formulated but wide-ranging definitions of ‘self-determination’ may give some insight to
tackle these questions. The idea of self-determination though, according to Nodia (1994:
9), ‘…emerged with movements for democracy and independence, both acting in the
name of ‘self-determination’: ‘we the people’ (i.e., the nation) will decide our own fate;
24we will observe only those rules that we ourselves set up; and we will allow nobody … to
rule us without our consent’.
No matter how broadly used and how much people are inspired by the hopes it
generate, self-determination is a vaguely defined political concept in both the political
and academic realm. As Wolfgang Danspeckgruger9 put it, ‘[n]o other concept is as
powerful, visceral, emotional, unruly as steep in creating aspirations and hopes as self-
determination’. In a more practical sense, Donald Watt defined self-determination as
‘[o]riginally the right of the subjects of a state to choose their own government or form of
government …encompass additionally the idea of national groups seceding from
multinational states and empires in order to set up their own national state’ (in Bullock et
al. 1988: 766-767). The Unrepresented Nations and People’s Organization (UNPO)10 has
a more broad definition which says that self-determination ‘[e]ssentially is the right of
people to determine its own destiny; … to choose its own political status and determine
its own form of economic, cultural and social development’. Article 1.1 of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966 also states that: ‘All people
have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely determine their
political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development’. These
three selected definitions understandably have a lot in common but they do not specify
who the subjects (in the first case) or the people (in the second and third case) are. The
assumption of who constitutes a people in these cases and in this study, however, is those
members of an ethnic nationality who are opting for a political status.
Though embodied in various provisions of the UN Charter, one can easily observe
the interpretation of self-determination as well as its objectives ranging from secession to
regional autonomy and its application encompassing individual as well as group rights.
Thus ‘[t]he right to self-determination remains one of the most intractable and difficult
problem to be addressed by the international community…. The subject has been the
basis for contention and war’, (Rupesinghe and Tashkov 1996: 20). As to its objective,

25‘Self-determination can be achieved in various forms: unitary state, federation,
confederation, autonomy’ (Ismagilova 1994: 11). There lies the enduring appeal of self-
determination, although the aspirations and hopes of the people in focus may or may not
be realized.
This principle of self-determination has developed in many phases to include
marginalized ethnic groups’ quest for equal rights or self-rule. Bugajski puts it more
specifically: ‘Ethnic leaders may seek to recognize the administration of the state from a
unitary to federal or confederate structure in which specific regions gain some degree of
provincial autonomy or full republican status’ (1994: 111). The pivotal political
conviction of ethnic nationalism is then that each and every ethnic entity is entitled to
self-determination. This seems impossible in a world where there are more than 2000
ethnic groups (Kly 2000). In Nigeria alone there are over 200 of them (Suberu 2006: 89).
When we take Ethiopia, there are around 80 ethnic groups (Turton 2006: 18).
Nonetheless, given the endless debate and controversy surrounding the subject, coupled
with the powerful influence and the unruly nature of self-determination, differences on
this point are likely to create more problems than solutions unless a consensus is reached
on what people ought or should aim to achieve by their struggle for self-determination.
It appears there is a broadly acceptable understanding that self-determination can
be achieved in one of the different forms discussed above, namely federation,
confederation, autonomy or secession. While the first three possible outcomes are
‘internal’ political settlements of self-determination that fall within the realm of a
democratic arrangement, the last one, secession, which involves partition of territory and
is usually achieved with actual or under threat of force, entails the formation of a separate
state which may or may not end up under democratic governance. Even if ‘[s]elf-
determination is one of the most important principles of contemporary international law
... Equally important is respect for territorial integrity and political unity of states. A
balance has to be struck between them’11. Looking for an acceptable balance for those

26who seek separation, on the one hand, and for those who want to maintain union on the
other hand is not an easy task by any measure. ‘Even when secession seems
straightforward and the seceding areas appear reasonably homogeneous, new conflicts
can emerge fairly rapidly’ (McGarry and O’Leary 1996: 335). Perhaps, the balance could
be struck in a thorough understanding of secession, which in turn leads us to investigate
the merits and/or demerits of secession as a solution to the quest of self-determination.
Summarizing the complexities surrounding secession McGarry and O’Leary
(ibid.: 334) wrote:
The normative idea behind principled partitions and secessions is the principle
of self determination. The key problem with the principle of self-determination
as a means of eliminating ethnic conflict is that it begs four questions:
* Who are the people?
* What is the relevant territorial unit in which they should exercise self-
determination?
* What constitutes a majority?
* Does secession produce a domino effect in which ethnic minorities within
seceding territories seek self-determination (i.e. secession) for themselves?
Dwelling on all the above questions is beyond the scope of this study, but for the purpose
of the argument and for what it entails in the multi-ethnic state of Ethiopia, we shall
consider the fourth problem that seeks to inquire into the spiral effect that secession of
one ethnic group induces on the other ethnic or even sub-ethnic groups. In this
connection, in her article ‘A critical analysis of the self-determination of peoples’.
Danielle Achibugi (2002)12 critically observes:
The noble and necessary principle of self-determination of peoples is
becoming the opening for a new form of tribalism and it is encouraging some
of the most reactionary tendencies present in contemporary society. If we
12At: http://www.unpo.org. 2002.
27wish to prevent it, we need to include its demands in a legal framework
shared both by the community claiming self-determination and by the
community that is rejecting it...’
McGarry and O’Leary (in Hutchinson and Smith 1996: 336) also expound on this line:
‘[w]hen formation of a separate state (secession) becomes the aim of a struggle, more
often there emerges a host of problems that lead to further crisis and conflicts and
‘secession remains an option very likely to produce violence, and problems (initially) as
bad as the ones it is intended to solve’.
Similarly so, N. Basic, D. Goetze and A. Smith (2004)13 explain the problems
associated with secession as follows:
‘..Many civil wars are provoked by secession crises in which minority groups
seek to secede from an existing state, state governments object to secession
plans, and violent confrontation is the result. We argue that the principles
embodied in international policy induce the actors in secession crises to
engage in violent conflict to further their goals rather than seek peaceful
resolution of their differences. Instead, we urge alteration of international
policy to provide incentives for the adoption of peaceful behaviors and norms
that can foster long-term cooperation and stability. We hold few illusions
about the ease with which stability can be secured in many regions of the
world...’
Gurr and Goldstone (1991: 332) argued that ‘ Ethnic self-determination in the twenty-
first century is more likely to fuel civil wars – among the Karen and Kurds, the
Tamils and Eritreans, nations fighting to establish their own state – than to motivate
revolutionary movements’. The intention to break away is obviously opposed by
13 See ‘Non Exclusionary Criteria and Stability in International Policy Making about Secession
Crisis(2004), at: http://www.tamilnation.org/selfdetermination/04Basic%20GoetzeSmith.pdf.
28unionists and more so by the state that has defended territorial integrity as acceptable
international norm. McGarry and O’Leary (in Hutchinson and Smith 1996: 336) also
added that ‘…the proposal of any community to secede from any state is likely to
encourage key elites in the affected states to behave in chauvinistic and warlike ways.
Normally secessionist movements provoke elites satisfied with the existing state into
mobilizing ‘Unionist’ movements against traitors’.
Indeed, it is not arguable that all people have equal rights and more specifically
the inalienable right of self-determination i.e. to freely determine their political status
and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. When these
inalienable rights are threatened or denied, there is a natural urge for people to
struggle (peacefully, otherwise violently) to regain and protect these rights. Under a
democratic system, such rights have grounds to be respected and the need for violent
way of struggle would not arise, where as, ‘Ethnic questions (leading to secession)
raise relatively non-tradable issues. Nationality, language, territorial homeland and
culture are not easily bargained over. They create zero-sum conflicts, and therefore
provide ideal materials for political entrepreneurs interested in creating or dividing
political constituencies’ (ibid.: 337). Therefore it is fundamentally the absence of
democratic means of settling social, economic and political matters that led to the
demand of self-determination in one form or the other. Once those popular demands
are adequately addressed and resolved in the interest of the deprived people, which is
the essence of the demand for self-determination, then the question of secession lacks
validity because, on the one hand, two political equals have better chances of
nurturing their rights to a greater satisfaction and on the other, there is no guarantee
the rights constituting self-determination would be respected after secession is
achieved. And more perplexing is the domino effect this trend would have in the
seceding entity now forging a separate state. Sub-ethnic groups, as we see it in
present-day Ethiopia, may come forward with perhaps legitimate claims which
eventually may be politicized by ethnic entrepreneurs to call for secession. Once
Eritrea seceded from Ethiopia officially in 1993, many other ethno-nationalist groups
29have emerged with similar claims. Although they have started their movement with
rather vague program long before Eritrea got independence, the Oromo Liberation
Front (OLF), the Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF) and the Sidama
Liberation Front (SLF) groups, to mention but a few, are striving to achieve that goal,
and unlike the general behaviour of states, the new Ethiopian Constitution (Article 39)
acknowledges this provision, at least officially. Again, in separated Eritrea too,
another wave of ethno-nationalist movements, like that of the Kunama or the Afar14
for instance, is on the rise. It looks like a phenomenon without end.
If secession, as an outcome of the struggle for self-determination, does not lead to
acquiring the democratic and human rights fought for, then what is its merit? What is it
that, in the final analysis, people gain by seceding? As indicated earlier, there is no
straightforward acknowledgeable answer, and the likely outcome is building a wall called
‘national boundary’ that curtails the free movement of neighbouring peoples, the
significance of which is, however, diminishing in today’s world. In other words, there is
no more union of people that necessitates defining a palatable relationship, for secession
simply happens to be an act of separation and not a process of formulating a system of
living together in a mutually acceptable and advantageous setting. As for the political
elite, it is a different matter; it has found a domain to rule over. In seceding states it is
often, if not always, the political elite that is assured of power and prestige. This has been
the general case with leaders of liberation movements in Africa (and elsewhere) which
will be discussed in subsequent chapters particularly in the comparative analysis section.
With the fusion of exclusivist secession in the inclusive tenets of self-
determination, it is more likely a clash of interest to manifest between those forces who
see the merits in democratically settled union and those who opt for separation under any
conditions. Evidently, such clashes have turned out to be violent and lethal. One of the
problems of secession is that it intends to create a wall between ‘we’ and ‘them’ who
hitherto have lived together under an undesirable system which has to be changed if
people have to live in peace and harmony. Proposing secession as a solution, however, is
14 See the work of Abdallah A. Adou 1993.
30the lack of understanding what secession entails among the parties involved, that is the
emergence of new conflicts while seceding entities could face another wave of similar
quest. Secession is not also necessarily followed by a democratic system. It has also been
argued recently that the right to self-determination could be exercised ‘internally’, within
an existing state. Internal self-determination would allow a people more control over their
political, economic, social and cultural development, while stopping short of full
secession. Unless the demerits of exclusionist secession are fully realized and separately
treated from the inclusive attributes of self-determination, multi-national states like
Ethiopia will continue to find themselves in endless crisis and conflicts.
Ethnic mobilization in a multi-ethnic society
Charles Tilly defined mobilization as a concept that ‘…conveniently identifies the
process by which a group goes from being a passive collection of individuals to an active
participant in public life’ (1978: 69), and in this process the ‘…group acquires collective
control over the resources needed for action’ (ibid.: 7). If we may identify a host of
effective tools of mobilization, definitely ethnicity is one, if not the most effective one.
This is because ethnicity is portrayed as an embodiment of subjective and objective traits
of human beings and through it any usable resource (human or material) can be provided
to promote the actions for the fulfilment of shared interest. Thus in many parts of the
world ‘[e]thnicity is the obvious basis for mobilizing opposition when an old regime has
held power on behalf of a dominant ethnic group …’ (Gurr and Goldstone 1991: 336).
In relation to ethno-nationalist movements, ethnic mobilization can be defined as
‘the process by which an ethnic community becomes politicized on behalf of its
collective interest and aspirations’ (Esman 1994: 28). The ethnic constituency of such a
movement can be classified as and assume the role of ‘leaders, activists, ordinary
members, or sympathizers’ (ibid.). While the leaders and a segment of the activists may
fall into the category of often educated revolutionary elite, the ordinary members are by-
and-large the peasantry and other rural or urban-based disgruntled social classes. Their
31interests and ultimate goals may also vary according to their position and the role they
assume in the movement. To the revolutionary elite, the whole purpose of the movement
could go as far as capturing state power, while members or sympathizers often aim at
mitigating their unacceptable circumstances and induce the emergence of a state upon
which they can impress their values to the satisfaction of the collectivity. Thus Esman
generalizes:
Mobilization may be prompted by a shift in the group’s collective
expectations or in the ‘reference group,’ the significant other, with which
they compare their own situation. Mobilization may be the result of events
that seriously threaten the community or, alternatively, present opportunities
too promising or attractive to resist (ibid., 30).
And ideology plays a role in systematizing the perception of the people’s ‘real’ interest.
‘One of the important ways ideology shaped choice was by inflating the perceived
spectrum of possibilities’ (Colburn 1994: 37) which allows different social groups to
anticipate the demise of he old state and hope for the realization of their dreams in the
state to come, thus mobilized to participate. This is why ‘[t]he spirit of the resistance thus
lays the foundation for a new social order’ (Selden, in Miller and Aya 1971: 215).
A wide and deep sense of grievance among ordinary people is a necessary
condition for counter-elites who seek to mobilize a mass following. There was no
shortage of grievances in the pre-revolutionary societies … In virtually every instance
threatened governments used force and violence in ways that increased popular
resentment and active support for revolutionary movements (Gurr & Goldstone 1991:
334). As Tilly said: ‘[t]he poor and the powerless often find that the rich, the powerful,
and the government oppose and punish their efforts at mobilization’ (Tilly 1978: 75). The
repressive action of the government in turn enhances the mobilization process already
underway.
32Mobilization can be performed in several ways depending on the situation in
which the ethnic community intends to achieve certain objective or on the threat pointed
at the community. Tilly (1978: 73-74) identifies three different ways mobilization is
carried out: defensive, offensive, and preparatory.
Defensive mobilization is induced by a threat from out side. This is a collective
action performed across the ethnic community challenging the assumption that
mobilization is always is a top-down phenomenon, organized by leaders and agitators.
The offensive and preparatory mobilizations are necessarily carried out often top-down
because they require an organization that can mobilize human and material resource to
execute a defined set of action(s).
Once mobilization is under way, Esman (1994: 31-39) identifies seven critical factors
that sustains and advances the ethnic movement:
• Political opportunity structure: the context in which the movement shapes its
strategies and tactics, and also its ideology and goals.
• Leadership: this symbolizes the movement and bears major responsibilities for
guiding it, articulating its values and collective interests etc.
• Ideology: provides a coherent set of articulated beliefs which defines the collective
identity, grievances, aspirations etc, explains and justifies the need of the
movement and cost of participation in the collective action.
• Organization: allows the aggregation and deployment of human and material
resources to engage in sustained political combat, civil or violent and also
facilitates the socialization of individuals into the movement.
• Goals: set the intended outcome – self-determination in its variant forms - of the
collective struggles that justify the cost and risk of mobilization.
• Resources: that feeds the movement to advance which is available within the
community or from external sources.
33• Strategy and tactics: this constitutes the long and short range methods employed to
achieve goals, the range of which may include from legal, civil disobedience and
non-violent disruptions to terrorism and insurrectionary violence.
In ethnic politics, an intensive agitation is underway to mobilize human and material
resources, the agitation of which is based on real or perceived content but often stretched
to the extreme and even dramatized with the obvious intention to marshal greater
people’s power into the political arena. For the purpose of ethno-nationalist mobilization,
ethnic symbols, memories and traditions are introduced often in a dramatic fashion.
‘Once deep ethnic divisions are mobilized into electoral and party politics (and more
pointedly into the struggle of self-determination); however, they tend to produce
suspicion rather than trust, acrimony rather than civility, polarization rather than
accommodation, and victimization rather than toleration (Diamond and Plattner 1994:
xix). It is this character of ethnicity that fosters the collectivity and mobilization of people
to commit for violent action. In this process,
‘If, on the other hand, we hold mobilization constant and consider collective
action itself, common sense is vindicated. Relatively poor and powerless
groups which have already mobilized are more likely to act collectively by
claiming new rights, privileges, and advantages. At the same level of
mobilization the rich and powerful are more likely to act collectively in
defence of what they already have’ (ibid.: 75-76).
Likewise, ‘[T]he hegemonic order reflects and thus reproduces the interest of the
dominant ‘ethnie’, by representing the ‘order of things’ in a distorted manner as
legitimate, democratic and moral, and by concealing its oppressive or more questionable
aspects’ (Yiftachel and Ghanem in Kaufmann 2004: 191).
Offering an ethnically charged alternative program in time of a general crisis and
presenting themselves as being the custodian of the Tigraian ‘national virtue’, the
34revolutionary elite of the TPLF found the numerous Tigraian peasant and other small
social groups responding positively to their calls. They were thus able to mobilize support
against their opponents who were portrayed as outsiders, and it was not difficult for the
TPLF to organize and create a power base in rural areas where the state had no effective
means of control or access to the people.
Peasant revolt and revolutionary elite: where do they conjoin?
Revolution does not occur without well-grounded reasons and there is always a group of
leader or an elite that theorize and give it the ideological flesh to walk it through to the
goals set in advance, no matter how general or incoherent they may be. The revolutionary
elite usually aim at capturing state power while the populace may only fight for a better
life under a new state where its voices could be heard and have an impact.
Ted Robert Gurr advances a broader perspective of revolution by tracing theories
from ancient history:
For Aristotle the principal cause of revolution is the aspiration for economic
or political equality on the part of the common people who lack it, and the
aspiration of the oligarchy for greater inequality than they have, i.e. a
discrepancy in both instances between what people have of political and
economic goods relative to what they think is justly theirs (1970: 37).
From this definition, one can observe that revolution is a dynamic process which would
occur whenever people feel denied of the rights that affect the well-being of their lives
and when the urge to restore them is heightened. This revolutionary dynamism is a sine
qua non of modernization and beyond. As Huntington (1968: 265) has it, ‘Revolution is
… an aspect of modernization. …It is most likely to occur in societies which have
experienced some social and economic development and where the processes of political
modernization and political development have lagged behind the processes of social and
35economic change’. In most developing countries like Ethiopia where overwhelming
majority of people are subjected to low level agrarian economy and where social and
economic development is sluggish, peasants are prone to revolt. In this circumstance
Skocpol writes:
Peasants are potentially rebellious at all times, and a political crisis gives
them the opportunity to revolt…. important at this juncture are the specific
agrarian structures. Revolution is likely when peasant communities (a) have
high degree of communal solidarity, (b) are quite autonomous as local
communities, yet (c) are supervised by a centralized bureaucracy (1979: 116-
117).
Moshiri also emphasizes that ‘[i]t is the combination of the state’s political crisis and the
peasant revolt that produces the social revolution’ (in Goldstone, et al. 1991: 28). With
this line of analysis McLane elaborates:
Three general conditions seem necessary for revolution to occur in peasant
societies. The first is the failure of rural social structure to meet the material
and other functional needs of the peasantry. The second is the decay or
removal of traditional agencies of social control, including the village landed
elite and the territorial administration. The final condition is the involvement
of the peasantry in a new or revolutionary social and administrative order (in
Miller and Aya 1971: 69).
The above noted factors for a revolution to occur are complementary if not the same with
those of Skocpol, argued earlier in different words.
Discontent can be caused by a variety of intervening factors but often is articulated
in relation to the state that claims to possess the moral and legal authority to manage the
affairs of the populace. Once discontent has been created, it can be easily politicized by
36the elite who seek change and civil disorder may follow. In this circumstance ‘[l]oss of
government legitimacy is an important if not critical factor in explaining civil strife
events. The legitimacy of the political regime is one of the most important of these
normative factors’, (Brinton 1965; Johnson 1966; Gurr 1970). And ‘If discontent is
intense and widespread in a society, revolutionary tasks are simplified; if not, there are
means by which it can be increased. Ideological appeals offer the best means, to the
extent that their content is designed to justify new aspirations and specify means towards
their attainment’ (Gurr 1970: 353).
But since ‘[p]easants are especially handicapped in passing from passive
recognition of wrongs to political participation as a means of setting them right (Wolf in
Miller and Aya 1971: 49), the role of revolutionary elite that mobilizes and organizes
forces of change becomes compelling. This is to say ‘Revolutions depend not only on
structural preconditions but also on actors committed to radical change’ (Colburn 1994:
17). In a society which has been heavily suppressed by reactionary political and religious
forces and where the peasant has been reduced to destitution for much longer period of
time, revolutionary zeal does not come easily. It requires organized revolutionary elite
that can galvanize a peasantry left destitute to the level of active participant in a
revolution through which it hopes to be liberated. It is true, ‘[i]n societies long stagnant,
corrupt, and repressed, revolutionary change has come to mean the possibility of formerly
wretched, impoverished masses seizing control of their own destinies and forging the
dynamic institutional foundations of liberation’ (Miller & Aya 1971: xiii-xiv).
Without the revolutionary elite that has acquired the knowledge to see beyond
existing conditions of life and paint the picture of the future, and draw the peasantry from
its preoccupation of earning daily bread, peasant revolution is less likely to occur,
although spontaneous peasant revolts may come and fade away. Therefore, revolutionary
elite is an indispensable ingredient of peasant revolution. McLane elaborates: ‘[e]ven
when revolutionary preconditions develop, a revolution requires mobilization of the
masses by leaders with organizational skills and ideology relevant to those particular
preconditions. Rebellion may be spontaneous; revolution needs leadership, planning,
37ultimate purposes, and their own institutions’ (in Miller and Aya 1971: 70). ‘The values,
expectations, phraseology, iconography, and implicit rules that expressed and shaped
collective intentions and behaviour can be called the intellectual culture of the revolution.
And it has been this intellectual culture, I will argue, much more than the imperatives of
social structure, that has provided the logic of contemporary revolutions’ Colburn (1994:
14). As revolutionary ideas are more than a kind of intervening variables that mediate
interests and outcomes, the intellectual skill of the revolutionary elite is crucial in the
formulation and guidance of the revolution. ‘They shape actors’ perceptions of
possibilities, as well as their understanding of their interests’ (ibid.: 104). Finally,
‘[r]evolution derives its significance from its contribution to long-term social and
political outcomes’ (ibid.: 10) and ‘[t]hus when the peasant protagonists lights the torch
of rebellion, the edifice of society is already smouldering and ready to lake fire’ (Wolf in
Miller and Aya 1971: 67).
Another important factor that influences peasant revolution is the involvement of
external forces which have the technological skill and the material power that could tilt
the balance of forces in favour of those who are on their side. In the study of peasant-
based revolutions, Skocpol (1994: 235) persuasively argues that ‘peasants are only part of
the story. A holistic frame of reference is indispensable, one that includes states, class
structures, and transnational economic and military relations’. Furthermore, ‘[w]hen
domestic elites sought change and superpower support depended on limiting repression
and international cooperation, the states faced a dilemma’ (Moshiri, in Goldstone et al.
1991: 34). To corroborate of this view, Colburn (1994: 13) has this to say:
…. Skocpol’s suggestion of the importance of interstate relations is
especially persuasive. The machinations of foreign states have played a
decisive part in the history of the world’s poor countries, most of which are
small and weak….Yet, it is important to acknowledge that the participants
make the crucial difference between a potentially revolutionary situation and
an actual revolution. Once the revolution is under way, their thinking and
38behaviour influence the revolutionary process. In turn, the course of the
revolution, its ebbs and turns, inescapably shapes the outcome.
Although Skocpol’s point has a strong bearing, it is the participants in the revolution, as
Colburn argued that make the ultimate difference. The success of the initially weak but
mass-based movements in Algeria, Cuba, Vietnam, China, Mozambique and Ethiopia
demonstrate the point made by Colburn.
Finally, revolutionary leaders create and deepen mechanisms of control in the
society they claim to liberate, ‘but this building and extension of control must involve a
complex dialogue with the villagers in whom the outsider learns as much, if not more,
about local organization and criteria of relevance than the local inhabitants.’ (Wolf, in
Miller and Aya 1971: 45-46). Through the different mechanisms created by the
revolutionary elite, the old system is replaced in any way possible including the use of
violence and ‘what is done with the power seized is consequential. An attempt at social
transformation entails a massive, and inescapably violent, restructuring of social
stratification. …Thus, the designation of what is and what is not a revolution is, in the
end, somewhat arbitrary’ (Colburn 1994: 7).
Whether we call the TPLF-led struggle for the right to self-determination ‘a
peasant revolution’ (as Young 1997 and Hammond 1999 put it) or not may require
further investigation. In any case, ‘[t]he linkage between intellectual trends and
revolutions is more apparent in the numerous revolutions that took place in the 1960s and
1970s (Colburn 1994: 28) and this has been also the case in Tigrai in particular and
Ethiopia in general.
Surely, revolutions occur not only because forces leading toward them are strong,
but also because forces tending to inhibit, or obstruct, them are weak or absent (Colburn
1994: 40). In traditional rural Ethiopia, the Marxist military Dergue was weak and absent
in many parts. This situation definitely gave ample opportunity for the revolutionary
force of the TPLF to manoeuvre freely in the rural areas and build a formidable peasant
force that finally enabled it to prevail over the state’s forces in Ethiopia.
39Guerrilla warfare and the state
When people find it impossible to peacefully engage a government that fails to bring
about political freedom and social justice, and their reasonable demands are met with
harsh measures, they react individually or collectively in defiance of the status quo, often
with the intent of bringing about the desired change. In this process, when conditions are
conducive, an organized movement is formed. In many cases, the movements resort to
unconventional ways and means struggle to achieve what they believe is legitimate,
socially just and politically right. The fact that revolutionary social movements are
reactions to social dislocation, perceived or real exploitation and disorder explains the
salience of their search for social redress and cultural authenticity and their moral rigor
(Walzer 1965; Arjomand 1986; Goldstone 1991). Committed revolutionary groups set the
stage of the struggle but such groups do not necessarily have the organizational capacity
and strength to confront head on an established state at least at the initial stage.
Therefore, such revolutionary groups resort to unconventional method of struggle, one of
them known as guerrilla warfare. Guerrilla war or as sometimes called insurgency
movement is carried out by irregular forces to win over the mass of the population from
the control of a government with the aim of finally overthrowing it. Guerrilla warfare is
indeed an age-old tactic ‘[b]ut only in modern times has it become the acknowledge
weapon of the weak, a symbol of our age, registering successes no less than setbacks
from China to Cuba, Malaya to Mozambique’ (Ahmad in Miller and Aya 1971: 137) and
considered a component of the doctrine of ‘peoples war’ as articulated by modern
revolutionaries like Mao Tse-tung, Amilcar Cabral or Che Guevara. ‘Once a
revolutionary movement enters the guerrilla phase’, Ahmad goes on, ‘its central objective
is not simply to achieve the moral isolation of the enemy but also to confirm, perpetuate,
and institutionalize it by providing an alternative to the discredited regime through the
creation of ‘parallel hierarchies’’ (ibid.: 157). This will be an ongoing process as the
40guerrilla forces gain strength and the warfare progresses from simple hit and run tactics to
more regular engagements, like ‘mobile’ warfare or even pitched-battles.
The emergence and development of the guerrilla warfare as a means of engaging a
repressive state assumes above all an uneasy relationship between the state and the
peasant society. It is within this crucial relationship of the state and the peasant society
that revolutionary groups find space to act. Some of the main features of peasants that
create the ground for revolutionary movements are best explained by Harrison (2002:
48):
- Peasants are neither passive nor traditional, but are part of modern social
system, acting and reacting from a position of relative weakness.
- Peasant society is defined by its resilience and flexibility in the face of
external forces.
- A key feature of postcolonial agricultural ‘development’ has been the
extraction of resources from the peasantry by state institutions.
- State elites have been antagonistic towards the plurality and ‘tradition’ of
their peasant societies
The state, thus, faces not only ideologically motivated and elusive armed revolutionary
elite but also a disgruntled mass of peasantry which is prepared to liberate itself from a
repressive regime and consenting to embrace the challengers of the state. Various social
classes that were repressed or marginalized by the regime are also agitated to join or
support the armed revolutionary movement. It is quite evident that the form of the regime
and its link to society is a crucial factor, for it in turn influences both the dynamics of the
domestic political conflicts and coalitions (Skocpol 1994; Goodwin and Wickham-
Crowley 1994). Furthermore, as Goodwin and Wickham-Crowley (1994) argue: ‘[a]rmed
revolutionaries become truly mass-based challengers, only when they mobilized
sustained support from more than peasants alone; they had to build nationalist support
coalition that include rural people, urban workers, middle-class people, and even (in
41some cases) upper-class acquiescers’. The essence of the revolutionary struggle is
therefore to completely isolate the state from the populace and push it to its grave. This is
why ‘[g]uerrilla warfare is dependent on a high level of popular involvement to provide
the demographic ‘sea’ for the insurgent ‘fish’ in Mao Tse-tung’s oft-quoted metaphor’ as
Ahmad (1971) and Selden (1971) demonstrated.
As we discussed above, Skocpol (1994) looks into another dimension to the
dynamics of the political conflict outside the domestic factors i.e. the external factor that
heavily influence the balance of forces between the peasant-based armed revolutionaries
and the state in third world countries. The involvement of foreign forces both materially
and diplomatically at international level, evidently, influence outcomes of the armed
confrontation between the state and insurgent movements as demonstrated empirically in
the struggle of the TPLF against the Soviet-backed military government of Ethiopia.
If organizational and administrative coherence are maintained or disrupted by the
intervention of external force which often is the case than not because of the prevalence
of transnational forces globally, the balance will tilt accordingly depending on who
harnesses the external reinforcement best. Therefore, welding together a broad coalition
of different social groups – large segments of the middle class, the peasantry and urban
workers - and foreign interests has been the key to successful insurrections (Dix 1984;
Colburn 1994). Because armed revolutionary movements can have one or the other
external support on their side either for ideological reasons or tactical interest, they
understandably would have a better chance of winning the war against a repressive and
isolated state. But even if we assume, more or less, similar level of external involvement,
it is the internal dynamics, considering the coalition of revolutionary social classes and
the peasants as actors, that dictates events at the end of the day.
Following the on-set of the revolutionary struggle, the behaviour of the state also
plays a significant role in influencing the bondage between the elite segment of the
revolution and the peasant masses. Skocpol (1994: 311) argues
42…although all kinds of repressive and exclusive authoritarian regimes are
potentially vulnerable to the growth (even sudden growth) of broad-based,
cross-class organizations or alliances of revolutionary challengers, the fact is
that such regimes can crush or fight off such challengers as long as their state
organizations remain administratively and coercively coherent.
In their comparative analysis Skocpol (1994: 305-6) and Goodwin (1994) seem to agree
that, ‘neither sheer poverty nor peasant discontent, not merely modernization or class
oppression, and certainly not the simple appearance of guerrillas or foreign aid to them,
can explain the relative successes and failures of guerrilla revolutionary movements …,
apart from domestic governmental conditions’. Also Gurr in his introductory remarks
emphasizes, ‘[t]here is a wealth of evidence and principle that repressive policies defeat
their purpose, in the long run if not necessarily in the short run. …But exclusive reliance
on force eventually rises up the forces that destroy it (1970: x), and often a self-defeating
fallacy is the perception of well established states, that dissidents will give up their
resistance by the threat or application of great force. This analysis helps us understand to
what extent a repressive regime (the militaristic Dergue of Ethiopia a case in point) by
employing sheer force and terror creates favourable conditions for revolutionary guerrilla
movements (like the TPLF) to grow and be crowned as upholding a just and legitimate
cause on behalf of the oppressed people. Indeed, ‘[i]f a regime responds to the threat or
use of force with grater force, the effect is likely to be an intensification of resistance:
dissidents will resort to greater force (Gurr 1970: 232) as they did so as to overthrow the
Dergue’s regime.
The linkage of ethno-nationalist revolt and the TPLF: a summary
From the theoretical discussions advanced this far, we can put in perspective the
emergence and prevalence of the TPLF in the Ethiopian power politics and what the
struggle guided by ethno-nationalist ideology has brought for the people of Tigrai and the
43various ethnic nationalities of Ethiopia. We can also look into whether such line of
struggle has resolved or reduced, or in the contrary aggravated ethnic conflicts and
tensions that have contributed to political instability and lack of development for a long
time in the historical of the country.
For people to revolt in the first place, there has to be repressive causes. These
causes are often skilfully articulated by a group or coalition of contenders for power who
advance an alternative organizational setup that removes the constraints hitherto imposed.
The idea of self-determination, as encompassing ‘all’ rights including secession, seemed
an attractive project of revolutionary movements in the 1960s and 1970s although its
limits and application remain full of controversies. The secession option in particular
tends to cement the ‘we’ vs. ‘them’ dichotomy and may end up in the disintegration of
multi-ethnic societies like Ethiopia. In poor societies where resources are scarce and
power is seen as a means to appropriate resources, ethnic groups and even emerging civil
society can find it difficult to live in harmony.
As a mobilizing tool, ethno-nationalism has been effectively utilized by the
revolutionary elite that led the TPLF. Evidently, the effective utilization of ethno-
nationalism has created a formidable power of organized social classes that could have
the strength to shake the government and change the status quo. Guided by the elite, the
struggle of the mobilized people might have shaken a government and helped its elite to
rise to power but whether that mobilized people could in turn effectively influence its
leaders (the revolutionary political elite) remains questionable. Therefore, using the
instrumentalist approach to ethno-nationalism, the TPLF looks at work in swaying the
masses of peasants and other social groups that conquered the well established Ethiopian
state under the Dergue. It is within this theoretical framework that we venture to
retrospectively and empirically assess the history of the TPLF.
44Chapter 3
Prelude to Struggle: the Emergence of the TPLF
Introduction15
The movement for the ‘right to self-determination’ led by the TPLF began in the hills of
western Tigrai. The origin of this movement was neither spontaneous nor an act of a few
disgruntled elite members. There were well-grounded objective and subjective factors
that gave rise to it. These could be explained both in historical as well as recent processes
of state formation and the attendant power politics that marginalized the people of Tigrai
and specifically its political elite. This chapter discusses, first the underlying causes of
the widespread resentment in Tigrai that became the fertile ground for the emergence of a
militant Tigraian elite that effectively utilized ethnic mobilization to create a force that
would eventually capture state power. This refers to the political history of Tigrai. Tigrai
was the centre of power and influence in the evolution of the Ethiopian state. The
subsequent shift of the centrality of power and influence away from the Tigraian to the
Amhara elite more often through force and manipulation but also because of external
interventions put Tigraians at a disadvantage. The second aspect of the discussion focuses
on the rivalry of the competing elites for hegemonic status, which obviously required a
force to maintain dominance – a force that was generated by mobilizing an ethnic and/or
regional constituency. This competition evidently depleted human and material resources
of every region and ethnic group where such rivalry took place. Due to historical

45circumstances, Tigrai was one arena of elite contention and its people had to pay the
consequences. The dismal situation in Tigrai in turn gave rise to the unrest in the form of
armed uprising, associational activities and political movements.
Aware of this historical interaction, the Tigrai National Organization (TNO), an
urban-based precursor of the TPLF, took the initiative to mobilize the people of Tigrai so
that they would struggle to assert their rights in the form of self-determination. They
articulated the theory and form of struggle that would help the people to come out of their
prevailing despair. Their capacity of articulation and skill of organization gave them the
vantage-point to lead the struggle on behalf of the people. Ethnic-based rhetoric
accompanied by class interest theories were the main tactics of mobilization. Influential
elderly people were also involved in the struggle as it was transformed from an urban-
based movement to rural-based guerrilla warfare.
How It All Began
‘Nothing can stop for one who rebelled at heart’ (Bilebu zishefete memlesi yebilun) is an
Ethiopian-Tigraian saying, meaning ‘Enough is enough’. When one is said to have
‘rebelled at heart’, one is poised to go even to war to achieve a certain goal. It is like
saying ‘War begins in the minds of people’. So was the war that was started by the Tigrai
People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) as a result of cumulative resentments felt by Tigraians
against successive Ethiopian governments. With the certain expectation that thousands
would embrace it, the TPLF’s armed struggle against the Ethiopian government of the
time, the military dictatorship of the Dergue (military committee) started on 18 February
1975 in an uninhabited remote region of Tigrai. A handful of Tigraians with four
outdated rifles launched the armed struggle from Dedebit in the remote hills of Western
Tigrai. In a subsequent protracted struggle that lasted for sixteen years, they mobilized
Tigraians behind the front and created a large disciplined army that defeated not only
rival fronts but also the military government itself. They finally seized power in Addis
Ababa in May 1991 by toppling the military regime, one of the strongest in Sub-Saharan
46Africa. Prior to this historic event, a tenacious struggle in Tigrai had, however, been
going on for many years in various forms against Emperor Haile Selassie’s monarchic
rule, creating the conditions for the TPLF to emerge and grow rapidly. Beginning with
the peasant uprising known as Woyyane16 in 1942-43, legal and illegal political activities,
strikes, underground activity, sporadic rebellions and even appeals for divine intervention
were methods used to challenge repressive rule and to mitigate the difficult life of
Tigraians.
Although such anti-government activities had also been taking place since 1961 in
the other parts of Ethiopia, including armed uprisings17 in Bale (1963-1968), Gojjam
(1967) and Eritrea, none had been successful. Finally, in February 1974, a spontaneous
revolution broke out at the centre that galvanized the entire Ethiopian population and
brought a dramatic change of government. Almost without resistance, the once mighty
Emperor was overthrown, and the whole monarchic structure and feudal system
collapsed, but only to be replaced by a military dictator of the worst order. The military
regime, which picked Marxism as its ideology en route to power, came to be more brutal
in its dealings with the Ethiopian people than the imperial regime, notably vis-à- vis those
who aspired democracy and justice, and even more so with Tigraians and other
marginalized nationalities whose demand was self-determination.
By July 1975 political power was fully in the hands of the military, a force better
organized than any other socio-political group in the country because of its long-standing
militarist tradition and organizational structures. On 12 September 1974, the Dergue had
put the Emperor under house arrest and officially declared it had seized power. The
young officers who constituted the majority of the Dergue elected the experienced and
charismatic General Aman Michael Andom, an Eritrean raised in Sudan, as a leader, only
to execute him a few months later in November 1974 because of disagreements over a
16 The Tigrigna term Woyyane means to rebel, or rebellion against an authority, as in Abeye or
Abeyot in Ge’ez (an old Semitic language now used by the Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox
Churches) and Amharic. The peasant uprising of 1942-43 in Tigrai was named Woyyane. The
TPLF also called its movement Kalai (= 2nd) Woyyane.
17 For more understanding on the uprisings, including the ‘Woyyane’ in Tigrai, see Gebru Tareke
(1991), John Markakis (1990), Patrick Gilkes (1975).
47host of issues, among them the question of Eritrea. Aman M. Andom was replaced by
General Teferi Banti, an Oromo, who was also killed shortly after being elected. Neither
general was a Dergue member but they were chosen ostensibly to calm the swirling
ideological and power controversies within the hastily formed Dergue. Colonel Mengistu
Haile Mariam, a younger officer from the 3rd Army Division based in Harar and
radicalized by the heat of the revolution, was at the centre of all these measures.
Mengistu Haile Mariam emerged as a domineering leader of the Dergue and ‘Ethiopia
Tikdem’ (Ethiopia First) which started as a common army slogan became the leading
motto of the revolution. In fact, Ethiopia Tikdem turned out to be an ideology which had
both a nationalist and a modernizing stance, thus ‘…directed against the weakening of the
state by ‘secessionist’ movements’ (Halliday and Molyneux 1981: 29). ‘Mengistu’s
regime in no time revealed itself as essentially no different from the previous regime
towards the assertive ethnic-nationalities, only this time accompanied by the harshness of
military dictatorship’ (Aregawi 2000: 99). The Dergue’s motto defined Ethiopia as a
monolithic society, thereby declaring any ethno-nationalist grievance or demand for self-
determination as being contrary to Ethiopian unity and interests. This rigid stand of
centralization coupled with Marxian rhetoric of the military officers was warmly
embraced by the former superpower, the Soviet Union, and supported both ideologically
and politically. As Ismagilova (1994: 28) observed, ‘advisors from the Soviet Union
upheld dogmatic positions and advocated for the suppression of nationalist movements
by force’. Although the Dergue pronounced a peaceful transition to socialism – ‘garrison
socialism’ in the words of Markakis (1990: 237) – and enacted a series of populist
declarations that seemed to benefit the working class and the peasantry, the moves of the
Dergue were in themselves far from peaceful.
Nationalists, who opted for some sort of autonomous rule or self-determination but
by no means amounting to demands for secession, were the prime targets of the Dergue,
as were other democratic Ethiopian elements. With the emergence of a military regime in
the midst of the political upheaval that had no organized leadership or well-thought-out
guiding objectives, many people already anticipated what was to follow. The Tigraian
48University Students’ Association (TUSA) was one such group that had foreseen the
predicament that would come with the Dergue. It was during this period of political
uncertainty, accompanied by the drums of terror, that many socio-political groups
emerged as national and multinational political organizations to challenge military
dominance. One such organization was the Tigraian National Organization (TNO) which
evolved into the Tigrai People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) and after sixteen years of
guerrilla war became the government of Ethiopia.
This is how it all began. On 14 September 1974, seven university students, Zeru
Gessese (Agazi),18 Fantahun Zeratsion (Giday), Mulugeta Hagos (Asfaha), Ambay
Mesfin (Seyoum), Alemseged Mengesha (Hailu), Amaha Tsehaye (Abbay) and Aregawi
Berhe (Berihu) met in an inconspicuous café located in Piazza in the centre of Addis
Ababa. Ato Gessesew Ayele (Sihul), twice an MP and still a popular representative of the
Tigraians at the time, belonged to this group but could not attend the meeting for security
reasons. All of them, including Sihul of course, had known each other for years in the
struggle against the repression of Tigraians in particular and Ethiopians in general.
The aim of the meeting was to: (a) wrap up their findings about the nature and disposition
of the Dergue’s regime with regard to the self-determination of Tigrai and the future of
democracy in Ethiopia, (b) discuss what form of struggle to pursue and how to tackle the
main challenges that would emerge, (c) outline how to work and coordinate activities
with the Ethiopian left, which had until then operated according to much broader
revolutionary ideals. These grand issues, quite general in scope, were not new as they had
been digesting them informally for a while and by the end of the day became the basis of
a two-page general guideline. The guideline19 declared that:
- The strategy is the formation of a democratic Ethiopia in which equality of all
nationalities is respected;
18 The names in bracket are ‘field-names’ (pseudonyms) given to the respective individual
members of the Front to disguise their identity for fear of an enemy pursuit. In the early days of
the guerrilla movement, most fighters had such field names.
19 The two-page guideline, handwritten in Tigrigna, was filed as a classified document in the
TPLF archives and kept in Meqele, Tigrai. But after the split of the TPLF leadership in 2001 such
documents are under the direct control of PM Meles Zenawi and stored in Addis Ababa.
49- A national armed struggle should be waged and advance from the rural area of Tigrai to
the urban area; and
- The movement should be led by an urban-based organization known as the Tigraian
National Organization (TNO) until the start of the armed struggle.
It was unanimously agreed that the TNO was a preparatory phase in the armed
struggle and its founders collectively assumed tasks including propaganda and political
work to prepare for the ensuing armed struggle, recruiting individuals as TNO members
from whom combatants in the armed struggle would later be recruited, collecting
materials and information necessary for the struggle, etc. To accomplish these and other
tasks, TNO’s founders had to reach and then organize the active elements in the Tigraian
association and political movements, who they would rely on in the painstaking, fight
ahead. It is therefore necessary to give a short account of the activities in the association
and political movement from which the TNO sprung and on which it would depend so
much in the following sixteen years of armed struggle in its attempt to bring down the
military government. But first it would be pertinent to start with a brief historical
overview that explains Tigrai’s standing and the perception of Tigraians in the making of
the Ethiopian polity.
Historical roots of the problem
It was not only the associational and political activities of the young elite that led to the
ethno-nationalist mobilization of Tigraians in pursuit of change. Ethno-nationalism, after
all, is not a phenomenon that should be characterized exclusively as an elite agenda, as
some analysts perceive it. Esman (1994: 14) rightly pointed out that ‘…ethnicity cannot
be politicised unless an underlying core of memories, experience, or meaning moves
people to collective action’. Historical symbolism and accumulated grievances
transmitted from generation to generation thus had their pivotal contribution in the
Tigraian uprising. For many years, as will be seen later, Tigraians had been agitating for
50self-rule or self-administration in place of the remote autocratic control that prevailed. It
is still the belief of many Tigraians that Tigrai, being the site of the ancient Ethiopian
state, deserved much more than what the modern Ethiopian state could offer.
The recorded history of Ethiopia as a state has its foundation in the present Tigrai
region in the 3rd century AD, then known as the kingdom of Aksum. The historian
Kobishchanov (1979: 59) quotes the Persian prophet Mani (216-276 AD) who wrote:
‘There are four great kingdoms on earth: the first is the kingdom of Babylon and Persia;
the second is the kingdom of Rome; the third is the kingdom of the Axumites; the fourth
is the kingdom of the Chinese’. Dating back to that time, the Aksumites had developed
their own civilization that could be illustrated in their script Ge’ez, the number system
Kutir and the calendar Awde-Awarih which are still in use today. Trade took them as far
as Persia and India in the East and Greece and Rome in the West through the Red Sea
ports of Adulis and Zeila. Their impressive architecture is reflected in the obelisks,
buildings and tunnels that are still standing in Yeha and Aksum. At the end of the 3rd
century AD, they had also started minting their own coins. In 340, the Aksumite King
Abraha (Ezana) adopted Orthodox Christianity, which quickly became the religion of the
inhabitants and provided the symbolism and substance of the royal ideology. With
Aksum as a pivot, the Empire expanded over the Ethiopian highlands. The Aksumite
civilization, according to Teshale Tibebu (1995: 3), who referred to it as Ge’ez
civilization, had ‘its core concentrated in the region from Debra Bizan in Eritrea to Debra
Libanos in Showa’.
The flourishing of the Aksumite civilization however did not last beyond the 7th
century. The expansion of Islam at the end of the 7th century, followed by the emergence
of a pagan Agew Queen called Yodit at the beginning of the 10th century, led to the
demise of the Aksumite Empire. Thus the political centre of the Ethiopian state began to
shift southwards where it revived in the 13th century as a restyled Aksumite kingship
under the dynasty of Zagwe, which succumbed to Yekuno Amlak in 1268. But a few
centuries later another debacle occurred. The re-emergence of Islam from the east under
Harari imam Ahmed ibn Ibrahim, nicknamed Ahmed ‘Gragn’ (= the left-handed) (1527-
511543), with the support of the Ottoman rulers, followed by the Oromo (then termed
‘Galla’, a now pejorative term) migration from the south was a devastating blow to the
remaining religious culture and declining civilization.
The gradual loss of dynamism of the centralized state in turn gave rise to the
emergence of local kings and princes who were often entangled in endless wars for
supremacy, ushering to a period of total anarchy. For instance, ‘Northern Ethiopia (Tigre
and present-day Eritrea) was divided into no less than twenty-four independent units’
(Zewde Gabre-Selassie 1975: 2-3) and had by far the highest number of firearms
compared to any other region in the country. During the period 1830-1850, Zewde
Gabre-Selassie noted, there were 28,000 matchlocks in Tigrai while Begemidir, Showa,
and Wollo had 4,000, 1,000 and 1,000 respectively (ibid.: 19). With the incursion of
foreign invaders through the gateway of Tigrai, firearms became abundant in the region.
This period of anarchy, which totally undermined the state, was known as the Zemene
Mesafint (Era of Princes) and lasted from 1760-1855. War became a common occurrence,
particularly in Tigrai, and the gun a highly revered asset of settling differences, replacing
the tradition of peaceful conflict resolution by religious leaders and shimagiles20 that had
persisted for centuries.
Amid this anarchy, Kassa Hailu, a rebel from Gondar, became Emperor Tewodros
(1855-1868) after defeating all the local kings and rases,21 and managed at last to
resurrect a semblance of centralism and stability in Ethiopia based on the same Aksumite
religious ideology. Kahsay Mircha, a rebel from Tigrai, succeeded Tewodros as Emperor
Yohannes (1872-1889) and was crowned in Aksum. Despite their success in re-
establishing the Ethiopian state, the reigns of these two emperors were neither stable nor
peaceful due to internal conflicts and external invasions. Locally, lords who aspired to
power had been rebelling whenever conditions favoured them (see Wylde 1970; Zewde
20 A shimagile literally is an elderly person but in a broader sense of the word it connotes one who
has the wisdom and legitimacy to help resolve conflicts. While religious leaders use their power
to restrain conflicts, shimagiles use their wisdom and influence to resolve and settle conflicts.
21 Ras, literally ‘head’ and equivalent to a duke, was a title next to the king in power and could be
given to a provincial governor, a prince or a minister.
52Gabre-Selassie 1975; Gilkes 1975; Erlich 1981; and Markakis 1990). Also, external
forces, including Britain in 1868, Egypt in 1875-76, Sudanese Mahdists in 1889 and Italy
in 1887-96 and 1935, carried out a series of incursions that made defence of the country
the main preoccupation of the rulers and the people, thereby disrupting stability. The
greatest war burden, as mentioned above, was inflicted on the gateway to Ethiopia,
Tigrai, and on the Tigraians. Noting the recurrence of wars against foreign invaders,
Haggai Erlich (1981: 195) wrote that ‘some 20 major battles were fought on Tigraian soil
between the Battle of Adwa (1896) to the Italian invasion of 1935. Even before the Battle
of Adwa, a series of similar battles took place in Tigrai. For instance, Ras Alula
encountered foreigner invaders at least sixteen times, ‘winning some ten decisive battles
– from the clash with the Egyptians in Gurae in 1876 to the Battle of Adwa against the
Italians twenty years ago’ (Erlich 1996: ix). When such battles against foreign forces
declined, local wars that were equally and sometimes even more devastating took place.
The battles against foreign invaders were fought to protect Ethiopia from aggression and
some took place outside Tigrai. Ethiopians of different ethnic nationalities, religion and
gender have shed their blood on fronts far from home. Yet, the fact that many of them
and the major ones took place in Tigrai – the gateway of the invaders – had long-lasting
and devastating effects on the region that were felt deeply by succeeding generations.
Local wars among regional chiefs and to resist the emergence of Kassa Hailu and
later Kahsay Mircha as Emperors Tewodros and Yohannes were countless. The peasant
population was constantly forced to side with one or other warlord in the battles and to
feed their predatory armies. Not only was a family’s food supply for a year or more
consumed instantly but food production was also hampered as the population was forced
to engage in war too.
On top of these wars, famine was taking its toll, dislodging the working population
and dismantling the fabric of society that had been built up for centuries based on
Aksumite civilization. As Young observed (1997: 49), ‘…in the period between the death
of Yohannes in 1889 and the present day an estimated seventeen famines have struck
Tigrai, the biggest being in 1958-9, 1965-6, 1972-4, and 1983-4’. During these periods of
53famine, millions died and still more were displaced from their homes. The spiralling
combination of foreign assaults, local wars and famines left Tigrai destitute.
Subsequent Ethiopian leaders – Emperors Menelik II (r. 1889-1913) and Haile
Selassie I (r. 1930-1974) did not bother to address or attempt to mitigate the state of
Tigrai, which was left to find its own course. The interest of the dominant elite during the
imperial period had been to defend the interest of the landed class and Orthodox
Christianity in general and the Amhara elite in particular (Addis Hiwot 1975; Gebru
1977, 1996; Teshale 1995, Merera 2002). In addition, the extensive wars in this Ethiopian
gateway, notably at Adwa (1896) and Maichew (1935) sapped the energy of the
productive forces and the region was devastated. During Menelik’s reign, Gebrehiwet
Baykedagne (1912: 12), a political economist at the time wrote, ‘there are hardly any
Tigraian youth left in their birth place, Tigrai. Like a swarm of bees without their queen,
they are aimlessly scattered in four corners of the earth. Some people ridiculed their
widespread poverty. Unfortunately, whilst other people live in tranquillity, Tigrai has
never been free from wars, leave alone outlaws and bandits’. Although the Italian
occupation of Ethiopia in 1936-41 roused resistance throughout Ethiopia (see Aregawi
2003), the intensity of the guerrilla movement was more pronounced in Tigrai, as it was
the aggressors’ launching pad. This situation seemed to have no end. While regions
adjacent to Tigrai were also markedly affected by these calamities, the southern part of
Ethiopia was relatively stable and gave sanctuary – but also derogatory names – to
fleeing Tigraians. Their mobility was sarcastically linked with a Land Rover to highlight
how they roamed over large rugged areas of the country and that their region was
condemned to ‘growing rocks’ instead of grain.
Years later, when in 1942-43 central and southern Tigrai peasants began to rebel
not only out of desperation but also as Blata Haile Mariam, one of the rebel leaders put it,
‘…to liberate Tigray from Showan Amhara hegemony if the central government failed to
respond to the call of the rebels and reform itself’ (in Gebru Tareke 1991: 186), their
plight was met with a harsh response. Haile Selassie’s government in collaboration with
the British Royal Air Force (RAF) after first dropping threatening leaflets addressed to
54‘The Chiefs, Balabats – People of Tigre Province’ on 6 October, devastated the region
including Meqele, the capital of Tigrai, also in October 1943.. The peasant uprising
known as Woyyane (meaning ‘revolt’) was quelled. Thousands of civilians lost their lives
as a result of aerial bombardments. ‘On 14th October 54 bombs dropped in Meqele, 6th
October 14 bombs followed by (unknown number) bombs on 9th October in Hintalo,
7th/9th October 32 bombs in Corbetta’ (Gilkes 1975: 180). But it did not stop there. The
people in that region were also forced to pay large sums of money and their land was
confiscated and distributed to loyal gentry as a punishment and deterrent against future
revolt. A new taxation system was imposed that ‘cost the peasants five times more than
they had paid under the Italians’ (Erlich 1981: 219). In the name of centralization, Haile
Selassie took away regional power from hereditary leaders and gave it to loyal
administrators, most of whom were from Showa22. This predicament again raised the
level of collective resentment, taking the form of ethno-nationalist sentiment against the
Showan ruling class. As Gilkes (1975: 187) observed, ‘Independence from Showan rule
was raised as a rallying cry and proved popular’. The British administrators in Eritrea at
the time – for their own strategic interests – keenly supported the popular cry of Tigraians
that their hereditary leaders should rule Tigrai, thereby concurring with the growing
awareness of Tigraian nationalism. ‘Before the British, the Italians had already advanced
this policy in what they named politica tigrina’, (Erlich 1981: 195). Indeed there were
many factors that nurtured the simmering Tigraian ethno-nationalism.
Not only grievances but also collective resentment towards power holders at the
centre were gradually building up and were passed on to future generations. As a result,
nobody seemed to recognize the authority of the central government, and sporadic
22 Showa is a region from which the Amharic-speaking ruling elite of Ethiopia, who largely
monopolized political power, originated. This class of Showan elites governed the rest of
Ethiopia from the beginning of the nineteenth century, the period of consolidation of modern
Ethiopia. See also the Gerry Salole, ‘Who Are the Showans’, in Horn of Africa 2(3), 1979, pp.
20-29.
55rebellion, locally known as shiftinnet (banditry),23 became a common occurrence. The
idiom in which it was expressed was ethno-regional identity. As Esman stated, ‘Ethnicity
is, thus, shaped by environment, by the threats and opportunities it affords’ (1994: 14).
In the 1950s and 1960s some of the rebels, however, were attempting to set up a
movement with a broader perspective. Like Haile-Mariam Reda who led the Woyyane,
the 1942-43 Tigraian peasant revolt, Gessesew Ayele was striving hard to create a broad-
based rebellion against the government. When the forerunner of the Eritrean Liberation
Front (ELF), Hamed Idris Awate, who had started as an individual shifta, set out to wage
armed struggle in Eritrea in 1961, many Tigraians, including Gessesew Ayele (Sihul)
made contact with him. Many politicized Tigraians showed sympathy and admiration for
the insurgents in Eritrea not in support of the secessionist agenda that was gradually
taking shape but out of their resentment for the government that had left the people of
Tigrai in misery and despair. Emulating the Eritrean movement as a courageous
challenge, many radical elements had, since 1970, been forming groups that were
contemplating an armed struggle to assert the rights of Tigraians. Besides Sihul, many
other individuals, among them Amare Tesfu, Tekeste Wubneh, Mussie Kidane, Gebre-
Meskel Hailu, Raswork Ketsela, Aregawi Berhe, Mulu Tesfay, and Atsbaha Hastire, were
involved in such challenges. In 1973, for instance, Amare Tesfu’s group would have
started an armed rebellion in Tigrai had it not been for the split that occurred at the last
minute on the nature of the Eritrean fronts with whom a working relationship was to be
established. Amare and Tekeste preferred cooperation with the ELF, while others
favoured the EPLF. These groups retained their differences until later years, when they
found themselves in one or other front but actually fighting the regime they all wanted to
get rid of.
Although it was hoped that the Ethiopian revolution that overthrew the Showan-
Amhara-dominated regime of Emperor Haile Selassie would address the plight of the

56Tigraians, such expectations soon proved unrealistic as the military fully intervened
towards the end of 1974. The military regime of Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam that
emerged did not waste any time in proving to be an enemy of Tigraian aspirations. Thus,
many Tigraian ethno-nationalist groups were formed who would not mediate with such a
regime but geared up to assert their rights through the ‘barrel of the gun’24. One such
group was the TNO, which eventually evolved into the TPLF.
The growth of associations
With its ancient and medieval historic monuments and churches across the land, Tigrai
still looked like a ruined village ravaged wars and neglected by successive governments.
Local conflicts and major Ethiopian wars against foreign invaders fought in Tigrai
severely damaged its agricultural system, the livelihood on which 98% of its population
depended, and stifled the initiative of the peasantry to produce and lead a more
prosperous life. The series of battles that ravaged Tigrai were mentioned earlier.
Recurring drought and famine also caused general decline. At the close of the 20th
century, agricultural practices were still ancient and backward. No single industry existed
to mitigate the stagnation of agriculture. Under Ras Mengesha Seyoum, the last
hereditary governor of Tigrai, an incense-processing factory was opened in Meqele in
late 1960 but soon collapsed. The machinery was bought from India but was outdated,
was probably second or third hand, and there was no money to revitalize it. Tigraians had
to migrate to the former Italian colony of Eritrea, or to Addis Ababa and other southern
Ethiopia cities in search of work, as conditions were relatively better there. But at the
same time it earned them derogatory names that wounded their pride. This dismal picture
of Tigrai persisted for decades and its young generation grew up with feelings of
desperation, which contributed to revolt. The neglect of Tigrai in the 1900s until the 1974
24 ‘Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun’ was a dictum of Mao Tse-tung, frequently
reiterated by the revolutionary generation of the time, ethno-nationalists and/or multi-nationalists
alike.
57revolution was perceived by many Tigraians as a deliberate and systematic policy of the
Showa-Amhara ruling class to weaken and demoralize them. This view was a reflection
of the historical rivalry between the two ruling houses and the Tigraian and Amhara
aristocratic classes. Once again it should be emphasized that, as Hizkias Assefa (1996:
35) rightly puts it, ‘this situation does not mean that the great majority of the Amhara
people have been ‘dominators’ or beneficiaries of the political, economic or social system
that bore their name’.
The educational situation in Tigrai was also dismal. There was no university or
college until the mid-1990s and there were only four high schools, but these offered
inadequate teachers and facilities for a population of about 3 million people and had only
been built in the late 1960s. High school students had been engaged in sporadic
movements to protest the dismal conditions of their schools and the misery reigning in
the region in general, but had no associational structure through which they could pursue
their demands. A few educated Tigraians began to raise their voice against the social
injustices that had befallen Tigrai. Among the initial activists according to Mitiku
Asheber,25 an activist himself, were Desta Bezabih, Abebe Tesema, Tesfay Teklu,
Rezene Kidane and Gebremeskel Abbay, while elders like Ato Gessesew Ayele and
Bahta Gebrehiwet were giving them official backings. With the collaboration of Ras
Mengesha Seyoum, a semi-legal cultural association called Bahli-Tigrai was formed,
thanks to the efforts of people like Ato Gessesew Ayele, Ato Hagos Alemayehu, Ato
Desta Bezabih, and others. Hundreds of students and teachers participated actively in this
association to promote their culture and assert their Tigraian identity. But so many
hurdles were imposed by the central government that the association fizzled away in the
space of two to three years. A weekly newspaper called Semyenawi Kokeb (Northern
Star) was also set up but that closed as well.
At the Haile Selassie I University (H.S.I.U., now renamed Addis Ababa
University), however, the political atmosphere was to a certain extent conducive for
students to articulate their grievances and get together to form associations of one kind or
25 Interview: Mitiku Asheber, Silver Spring, MD, USA, 24 July 2003.
58another, but not without cost. At home and at school, students were persistently uneasy
about the difficult life and oppressive system that the majority, from which they came,
had to endure and the luxurious lifestyle the ruling classes were enjoying in this poor
country. Thus most students from Tigrai, when they joined the university, took it as part
of their student life to participate actively in protests calling for change either at a
national or regional level. This was why many university students from Tigrai had been
playing a prominent role in the struggle against Haile Selassie’s feudal regime. They
were not aiming to restore Tigraian hegemony, as some naïve politicians have presented
it. In actual fact, they were comrades in struggle with revolutionary students like
Wallelign Mekonnen (a Wollo Amhara) who had been writing persuasive articles,
including ‘On the Question of Nationalities in Ethiopia’.26
Teachers and students from all districts of Tigrai also converged at H.S.I.
University in Addis Ababa and raised issues concerning their region. Land degradation,
recurring famine, mass unemployment, political marginalization, cultural domination and
different social problems were some of the issues raised by students. They compared the
level of these problems with those in other regions of Ethiopia and believed the
conditions in Tigrai to be by far the worst. This assessment was more often expressed
sentimentally in relation to the past glory of Tigrai and its standing in the history of
Ethiopian nation building. This movement began in the late 1960s when the pan-
Ethiopian student movement was growing in scope. Earlier prominent activists in the
Tigraian students’ movement included people like Sibhatu Wibneh (killed by Haile
Selassie’s security agents in 1970), Giday Gebrewahid (killed in mid-1975 by the Dergue
soon after it came to power), Amare Tesfu (killed in early 1975 by a group called the
TLF, of which he was a member), Tesfay Teklu, Mitiku Asheber, Abebe Tesema, Desta
Bezabih, Atsbaha Hailemariam, Gebrekidan Desta, Rezene Kidane and others. The
Tigraian University Students Association (TUSA) was formed in the early 1970s. The
26 Wallelign Mekonnen had unmasked the plight of oppressed nationalities of Ethiopia with his
influential article ‘On the Question of Nationalities in Ethiopia’ in the publication of the
University Student’s Union of Addis Ababa, Struggle, vol. V, no. 2 (17 November 1969).
59TUSA had pledged to function not only in Addis Ababa but also in Tigrai when the
university closed for vacation. Many Tigraian university students, including all the
founding members of the TNO (precursor of the TPLF) were involved in the
association’s activities both during and after the school year. As members of the
university community, they were also actively participating at all levels of the Ethiopian
student movement and, in most cases, taking a leading role. Meles Tekele, later killed by
the Dergue, and Abbay Tsehaye, who still survives in the EPRDF leadership today, were
TUSA members who led the editorial branch of the university students’ union. Aregawi
Berhe headed the university’s political science students’ association for a year (1972-73)
and Berhane Eyasu, a leading member of the leftist Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary
Party (EPRP) who was killed fighting the Dergue was also a TUSA activist before he
joined the EPRP.
In Addis Ababa, TUSA’s function was limited to discussions of a political nature
and to contacting influential people such as parliamentary members, businessmen and
professional people from Tigrai to encourage them to contribute something tangible to
mitigate the dismal situation in Tigrai. To broaden ethno-nationalist awareness and reflect
on necessary measures, occasional informative papers like Etek (Get Armed) and Dimtsi
Bihere Tigrai (Voice of the Tigrai Nation) were produced and distributed freely to the
people. Such activities were inflammatory in nature nevertheless attracted many
Tigraians who were engaged in various walks of life to the political arena where the
authority of Emperor27 was beginning to face open challenges from different section of
the society other than students. The contribution of Tigraian Members of Parliament like
Ato Gessesew Ayele (Sihul), Ato Asfaw Wolde-Aregay, Ato Alemseged Gebre-
Egziabiher, Weyzero Tsehaytu Gebresellassie, qegnazmach Teklit Mekonnen and Ato
Zenawi Tekola was immense, both in terms of financial input and advice. Also
intellectuals and professionals, among them Ato Bekele Berhane, Dr Assefa Abraha, Dr
27 Under Emperor Haile Selassie, the 1955 Constitution stated in no uncertain terms that the king
was above censure: ‘By virtue of His Imperial Blood, as well as by the anointing which He
received, the person of the Emperor is sacred, his dignity inviolable and his powers indisputable
... Anyone so bold as to seek to injure the Emperor will be punished’ (Article 4).
60Itbarek Gebre-Egziabiher, Ato Tsegaye Hailu, Ato Hagos Atsbaha, Ato Kidane Asayehgn,
Ato Aynalem Aregehegn and Dr Tesfay Berhe gave initial support to the movement. Such
people and many others saw themselves as victims of ethnic repression and political
persecution. Ato Alemseged G. Egziabiher, for instance, was tortured in prison for
months under the Haile Selassie regime for his progressive views as a parliamentarian.28
The major activities of the association, however, were carried out in the eight awrajas
(districts) of Tigrai, particularly during the Ethiopian winter when the university closed
for vacation. Supplementary education for high school students, developmental work like
reforestation and political awareness-raising were the focus of the association’s activities.
The educational and developmental activities were discharged with legal permits and the
cooperation of the then governor of Tigrai, Ras Mengesha Seyoum. On one occasion,
when leading TUSA members approached the Ras in Addis Ababa, he went so far as to
openly criticize various ministers, particularly the minister of education at the time, for
standing in the way of his developmental policies in Tigrai. This was an unexpected
remark from a governor who belonged to the ruling class. Unlike his traditionalist father
Ras Seyoum, who belonged to Emperor Haile Selassie’s generation, Ras Mengesha was
well-educated and styled himself as a modernizer. By setting himself as an example, he
made several attempts to reform the negative attitude towards manual labour that was
prevalent among the well-to-do class in Tigrai. He in person participated in several
development activities that required hard labour: he opened new roads, built a number of
bridges and encouraged entrepreneurs in the field of agriculture, particularly in cash crop
plantations. His reformist endeavours earned him a degree of popularity among a section
of the urban elite. Later when he formed the EDU to counter the Dergue, it was part of
this group that joined his movement or became clandestine supporters for his movement
from the towns. In the eyes of many, Ras Mengesha was a benevolent governor in
Ethiopian royalty who opened up, among other things, a limited space for TUSA
members to conduct their activities.
28 Interview: Alemseged Gebre-Egziabiher, Los Angeles, CA, USA, 18 August 2003.
61The political awareness activities of the TUSA, however, were carried out without
the knowledge of the Ras or other government authorities, which would have thwarted
every activity of the association when learning that they themselves were blamed for
collaborating with the oppressors in the central government. Essentially, Ras Mengesha
himself was seen as an accomplice of the ruling stratum both by marriage and class-
interest, and hence an element to be removed by the winds of change.
While advancing the associational programme, clandestine groups were organized
to study Marxist dialectics, the class struggle, the national question and other
revolutionary issues at the time. These study groups would use every legal opportunity to
disseminate their revolutionary ideas with the aim of raising the level of consciousness of
the people as a whole. The dissemination of revolutionary ideas was carried out through
leaflets, songs and informal discussions. Everybody seemed motivated at the time either
to give or receive revolutionary ideas that advocated change, and the call for armed
struggle to get rid of the oppressive feudal regime was entertained without actually ever
being mentioned.
Within the association, a politically conscious group that aimed at creating a
higher form of organization by the name of Mahber Gesgesti Bihere Tigrai (MAGEBT)
evolved at the beginning of 1974. Literally translated it read as the Association of
Progressives from the Tigrai Nation, but for convenience it was named the Tigraian
National Organization (TNO). TNO was later to become the mother organization of the
TPLF. While these TNO-led activities were underway, another group called the Political
Association of Tigraians (PAT or Mahber Politica), led by Yohannes Teklehaimanot and
Gebre-Kidan Asfaha was involved underground in a purely political mobilization of
Tigraians against the Ethiopian regime. This association advocated outright independence
of Tigrai and later emerged as an armed organization known as the Tigrai Liberation
Front (TLF), which will be discussed in later chapters.
62A Political Movement
The Ethiopian student movement of the 1960s and 1970s was marked by a political
radicalism the country had never before experienced. It was full of eventful struggles
against ‘imperialism’ and ‘feudalism’ – systems that were believed to have kept Ethiopia
in a backward stage of development. Most of the younger generation who had been
through high school and university were revolutionary enthusiasts along this ideological
and political wave. Their dream was to change Ethiopia’s backwardness in a
revolutionary manner by paying whatever sacrifices were required – sacrifices that
sometimes surpassed their limits. At times, they played the role of a political party in
opposition. The experiences of Bolshevik Russia, Maoist China, Ho Chi Min’s Viet Nam
and Che Guevara’s internationalism were espoused as guiding precedents to redeem
Ethiopia from its predicament. The revolutionary student generation of the time was, as it
proved later on, poised to render any service in uprooting the grips of ‘imperialism’ and
‘feudalism’ in the country. This revolutionary fervour was part of the international wave
of the 1960s. Marxist revolutionary ideals were thought to be the only appropriate
guiding tenets through which the country could be transformed.
Although a class-based ideological orientation was prevalent among the student
body, ethno-national mobilization was an additional and concomitant ideological stance
in the students’ movement. Marx’s position on the Irish national question, i.e., that it had
to be resolved for the British proletariat to advance to socialism, was recalled to justify
the question of nationalities in Ethiopia. Also Leninist and Stalinist theories on the
national question were utilized as tools in combating national oppression in Ethiopia.
Revolutionary students referred to Ethiopia as the ‘prison house of nationalities’.
Ethno-nationalist sentiment among the young educated class was expedited by
several factors. On the one hand, the monopoly of power in the grip of the Showan-
Amhara ‘feudal class’ that fostered its ethnic hegemony and was held as keeping Ethiopia
in the dark was the prime cause for ethnic resistance. On the other hand, the influence of
the previous rebellions in Tigrai (1942-43 Woyyane), in Gojjam (1967 revolt), in Bale
63(1963-68 rebellion) and in Eritrea (the 1960s and 1970s armed struggle) served as
historical precedents to challenge the existing state of affairs. Those who came from
marginalized ethnic nationalities wanted to assert their denied identity and equality by all
means. Revolutionary students from the dominant nationality, the Amhara, also upheld
the principle of the ‘right of nations to self-determination’. Wallelign Mekonnen (see
above) in his influential article on the national question in Ethiopia in November 1969
had stated that ‘…Ethiopia was not a nation, but a collection of nationalities ruled by the
Amharas. To be an Ethiopian, you will have to wear an Amhara mask’ (cited in Kiflu
Tadesse 1993: 54). Moreover, the negative and repressive reaction of the state towards
such sentiments and the dreadful conditions in respective ethnic localities were other
important factors that solidified ethno-nationalist sentiment among the various ethnic
groups.
Members of the TNO, who saw no contradiction or ignored any idea of
incompatibility in the class and ethno-national forms of struggle, actively participated in
both forms of the struggle. If and when guided by a Marxist ideology, the ethno-
nationalist movement was presumed to be a sub-set of the class struggle, the former
levelling the way for the latter. For them the struggle for a democratic Ethiopia was
tantamount to bestowing the right to self-determination of its components, where all
people could live harmoniously in a fairly defined political and economic relationship.
However, those who saw ethno-national struggle as a tactic for achieving equality within
a united Ethiopia and not as a strategy for secession were not aware of the turns and
zigzags that ethno-nationalist mobilization could take. They were not able to see that ‘the
more politicised ethnicity becomes, the more it dominates other expressions of identity,
eclipsing class, occupational, and ideological solidarities’ (Esman 1994: 15) and would
turn ominous. The young revolutionaries focused only on the positive contribution of
ethno-nationalist mobilization as the most effective and shortest way to uproot the
oppressive system. They appeared to agree with Horowitz (1994: 49) who put emphasis
on the positive aspect of ethnicity and ethnic affiliations as providing a sense of security.
The turns and zigzags inherent in ethno-nationalism were later to surface with the growth
64of the TPLF. They failed to see in advance elements that managed to obscure class,
occupational and ideological solidarities and, even more so, common historical realities.
In Tigrai, the Woyyane uprising of 1943 in it alone might not have invoked the
ethno-nationalist sentiment exhibited in the young revolutionaries of the 1970s. There
was more to it. The subsequent punitive measures of the central government and
especially the bombardment of Meqele, the capital of Tigrai, by the British Royal Air
Force (RAF) on behalf of Haile Selassie’s government, was one popular grievance. The
neglect of the region even when it was experiencing its worst famine on record, in 1972-
74, that left more than half the population destitute, plus the cultural domination, as
reflected in the linguistic disparities, were some of the other factors that led to ethno-
nationalist-based resentment. These grievances were well articulated by Tigraian
students. The persistent failure of the state to resolve the simmering resentments in their
respective localities became clear and spurred ethno-nationalist mobilization.
In this political atmosphere, progressive Tigraian students formed the TNO and
continued participating actively in the Pan-Ethiopian student movement. They played an
active role in all the major political activities that brought about the downfall of Haile
Selassie’s monarchy. When the Provisional Military Administrative Council (PMAC) or
Dergue took over, they still persisted in forming a Pan-Ethiopian front to get rid of the
military administration and institute a civilian participatory democratic system. TNO
members played an outstanding role in exposing the cynicism behind the Dergue’s
‘Campaign of Development and Co-operation’ in 1975-76 – a scheme intended to
disperse the critical student body and control or eliminate its radical elements. In the
course of these revolutionary days it was discovered that eight prominent members of the
TNO because of their high profile in the revolutionary activities were on the hit list of the
Dergue’s security office. This revelation forced not only those on the list but also other
radical Tigraians to go underground or leave the Dergue-controlled areas and find shelter
in rural Tigrai or abroad. Some of these who stayed behind in the Dergue-controlled area
– revolutionaries like Meles Tekle, Giday Gebrewahid, Abraha Hagos and many others
were soon killed by the Dergue. Those who left for rural Tigrai were not just going in
65search of mere shelter but also to find the ways and means to launch resistance against
the government. The TNO had contacts with many of these radical Tigraians and later it
was not difficult to assemble them in the TPLF. The TNO’s political goals seemed to
have been achieved ahead of time when it transformed itself into an armed organization,
the TPLF, later in February 1975. Some critics argue that the TNO should have joined
either the ‘revolutionary Dergue’ or other multi-national organizations29 before rushing to
forge the ethno-nationalist TPLF. However, under the circumstances of that period which
was already discussed above, both options turned out to be unacceptable.
The Role of Sihul30
In the traditional society of Tigrai, hardly anybody took the students’ movement
seriously, and when it came to waging an armed struggle, elders scorned it immediately
and said mockingly: ‘they must be joking’; ‘they will return to their mothers tomorrow’.
People probably remembered the harsh experiences of past suppression, like in the 1943
Woyyane revolt. But for one elder Tigraian politician, Ato Gessesew Ayele (Sihul),
though of a different generation than the revolutionary students he joined, to wage an
armed struggle in the 1970s was not an impossible notion. Sihul was in his late fifties
when he left his family and his well-paid public post to indeed start armed struggle with a
few young university students in their early twenties. It was not the first time for Sihul to
rebel against a repressive system. As a young boy of 14, he had resisted the Fascist
Italians who occupied Ethiopia from 1935 to 1941 and went with his uncle as far as the
Southern Front to fight the invaders. In 1962, he rebelled against Haile Selassie’s
monarchic rule and once met Idris Awate, a prominent fighter in the Eritrean Liberation
Front (ELF), to create a ‘unity of struggle’. It did not materialize because of the Eritrean
29 The nearest any organization the TNO could have worked with was the Democracia-Abeyot
group which later formed the EPRP, but differences on the question of self-determination and
more so on the nature of the struggle that had to be waged against the military Dergue kept them
apart. TNO stressed rural-based armed struggle while the EPRP opted for urban-based
insurrection.
30 Sihul was a ‘field name’ (pseudonym), given to Gessesew Ayele during the armed struggle.
66secessionist stance. Gessesew was a committed Ethiopian nationalist who never
embraced the secession of Tigrai as an option, unlike some of his young revolutionary
comrades. He was a man who rebelled against higher authorities whenever he observed
that they were failing to respect or render justice to ordinary people.
His rebellious character in imperial Ethiopia, where absolute loyalty to higher
authorities was expected and could not be questioned, gained him popularity not only in
his own district of Shire but also in the whole province of Tigrai. Whether he held a
government post or not, his house at Enda-Selassie, Shire, was full of peasants with
problems seeking his advice and influence. He held many government posts but soon
when he found himself at loggerheads with senior authorities, including Ras Mengesha
Seyoum, the last hereditary governor of Tigrai, he went back to his locality to pursue his
rebellious life. In the early 1970s, the people of Shire had overwhelmingly voted for him
to represent them in the Ethiopian parliament. Time and again, he stood not only for the
cause of his constituency but also for general Ethiopian causes. At last, he felt he had to
rise up in arms against the military dictators who had toppled Haile Selassie’s regime,
although the new rulers had promised to elevate him to higher posts considering his
background and popularity.
Gessesew Ayele was not only just one of the founders of the TPLF but also a
person whose background and personality made an immense contribution to the smooth
development of the TPLF, especially in the initial stage of the struggle. Dedebit, a remote
terrain in Shire, was selected as the place to start the armed struggle because Sihul had
prior knowledge of this area and, more importantly, he had the respect of the people
living in the villages adjacent to this land. The people in these villages would definitely
have been hostile to the unknown students whose activities were centred only in the
towns. When representatives of the people in Shimelba, Tselimoye and Adi-Mohamedai,
three villages surrounding Dedebit, were approached by the front to render their support,
they did not hesitate. This compliance was granted not because they understood the
objectives of the emerging front or because of the young revolutionary students, but
simply because Sihul, whose views they knew well and whom they respected deeply, was
67in it. Thus, it was not surprising that for some months to follow the front had been
referred to not by its proper name, the TPLF, but as a group that belonged to Gessesew
Ayele.
When the armed struggle started on 18 February 1975, Gessesew got his nickname
‘Sihul’ after the 18th century powerful Tigraian warrior and king-maker Ras Mikael Sihul
whose strength was felt as far as Gondar and Wollo (cf. Abbink 2007). Ras Mikael Sihul
was known for his decisive action and for getting rid of, in his opinion, inept or
‘illegitimate’ emperors and replacing them with those of his own choice. He removed
King Iyoas in 1769 and ‘…was responsible for placing the next two Emperors on the
throne’ (Gilkes 1975: 7). But Gessesew Ayele was a man of higher political persuasion in
a different era. He grew up in the heat of the Ethiopian Patriotic struggle against the
Italian invasion (1935-41) and was politically shaped in the era of Ethiopia’s struggle for
modernization and democratic revolution of the 1960s and early 1970s. His passion for
justice for ordinary people explains why, at an elderly age, he joined young radical
students to wage an armed struggle for political change and more self-determination for
Tigrai.
Sihul belonged to an extended family, was married to Woizero Zimam Gebre-
Hiwet, who supported him throughout his rebellious life, and had seven children.
Although he was kind and caring to his family, domestic responsibility did not stop him
from once again engaging in the armed struggle against the new military dictators that
later would cost him his life in 1976. This commitment earned him a lot of respect, even
from his rivals. Asked about the death of her husband, Woizero Zimam often said ‘Nebir
bitemot lij teketta’31 (i.e., ‘If a panther dies, it leaves behind offspring’).
Sihul’s role in the struggle was irreplaceable. As said above, without him the
unknown TPLF would have found it difficult to survive and expand in the shifta (bandit)-
infested district of Shire. Some of the shiftas of the criminal type, like Alem Eshet,
considered themselves kings of their domain. They owned automatic rifles and
31 Woizero Zimam also said this in an interview with the daily Addis Zemen, Meskerem 9, 1991
(Ethiopian Calendar).
68commanded large groups of bandits. They knew the rocky terrain like their backyard and
how to negotiate it. They could sweep from their territory any unfamiliar group like a
TNO if not for the respect and popularity commanded by Sihul. The name Sihul and that
of his younger brother Berhane Ayele appeared more than a match to any group of shiftas
in the district. At that early stage of the struggle, even fellow peasant fighters used to treat
the student fighters as ‘kids who only know how to play with paper’ and believed that
they should be led by the peasants who could manage a gun. Unless the university
students proved that they were worthy to fight and lead an armed struggle, the path for
the front would have been rocky and costly, had it not been for the presence of Sihul.
Mainly because of what he stood for in the previous years the TPLF had no problem in
building up legitimacy and popularity right from the beginning. Thus, from the start the
respect he earned to this day and the determination he exhibited in fighting for the cause
of Tigraians gave the Front this legitimacy and popularity, that none of its other members
could procure. Indeed, Sihul’s role in the struggle was immense and requires special
emphasis. Further details of Sihul’s role in the TPLF will come up in coming chapters.
The People on the Eve of the Armed Insurrection
The population of Tigrai in the 1960s was estimated to be about two million (Markakis
1990: 250) and in the 1970s was estimated to be about five million (by the TPLF party
magazine Woyeen, August 1978: 4). But the 1994 Population and Housing Census of
Ethiopia recorded it as 3.1 million.32 More than 75% of the population speak Tigrigna, an
old spoken and written language but since the 1940s forbidden in schools and courts by
the central government. It could therefore not develop. The other spoken languages were
Afar, Saho, Agew and Kunama. More than 90% of the people lived in the rural areas,
engaged in agriculture with a small percentage of pastoralists living in the lowlands. In
the densely populated highlands, because land had been privately owned for generations
32 See: Report of the Population and Housing Census Commission, Government of Ethiopia,
Addis Ababa, 1996, p. 10.
69in a system known as rist, in which every lineal family member could claim a plot, land
fragmentation increased the fragile base of agricultural production, forcing the bulk of the
peasantry to live below subsistence. Still worse, recurring famines (like that of 1972,
1973 and 1974) as a result of drought and locusts claimed the lives of tens of thousands
of peasants. The government authorities not only neglected the plight of the people but
also kept on levying numerous taxes that were practically impossible for the peasants to
pay. As a result, thousands of peasants abandoned their villages with or without their
families and roamed elsewhere in search of food and work. It was a common scene to
observe desperate families seeking shelter in churches and mosques and begging for food
on the streets. Life was literally intolerable and desperation reigned.
The people of Tigrai in general and the educated section in particular were in a
continuous state of suspense following the radical student movement of the early 1970s,
which called for radical changes, and the spontaneous revolution of 1974 which uprooted
the imperial system. All seemed anxious to see a reliable organization to lead them
through this state of uncertainty and harsh life. People voiced their readiness through
songs, writings and other available means to pay any price for the struggle that could
bring them the anticipated better future. A series of events like the dramatic fall of the
Emperor, the flight of the hereditary provincial governor of Tigrai, Ras Mengesha
Seyoum, and the seizure of power by an unknown group of military officers with an
unfamiliar agenda, increased their expectations. However, a legitimate organization to
guide them through this erratic period was lacking. Someone had to fill this vacuum.
Except for the weak feudal class and the clergy that wanted to retain the existing
land tenure relationships, members of the other social classes were entangled in endless
heated debates as to what should follow and how to go about it. In the absence of any
kind of political organization or union to coordinate the opinions of the people, the level
of confusion that reigned during this period in the early 1970s is not hard to imagine.
Underlying this general apprehension were the dire conditions of the peasantry
with their accumulated grievances. The persistent call of the young educated class –
basically students and teachers – for radical change and the ‘self-determination of Tigrai’
70as a rallying slogan fuelled their aspirations. With this, the imposition of central control,
the domination of the Showan-Amhara ruling class, heavy taxation and the neglect of the
leaders in mitigating the difficult life of the people were reiterated in every forum. ‘The
state’s most painful act of all was the banning of the Tigrai language in a region where, as
late as the mid-1970s, only 12.3 per cent of the males claimed to speak Amharigna and
only 7.7 per cent could read it’ (Stavenhagen 1996: 8). All this unrest in Tigrai could be
seen as a reaction to a number of oppressive factors for which the ruling class, the
Showan Mekwanent (nobles), based at the centre of political power, was responsible.
‘Showans have, of course, continued to run Ethiopia, to monopolize the top
administrative and political positions, to govern the provinces and to reap the economic
benefits of the concentration of industry and urbanization in Showa. Yet they are now
identified as ‘Amhara’, not as ‘Showan’’ (Salole 1979: 27). And indeed, ‘Amhara
domination’ does not include the Amhara peasantry as dominators but only refers to the
ruling elite of Showa (Clapham 1975). These circumstances placed the call for self-
determination as the central rallying slogan, even during and after the outbreak of the
Ethiopian Revolution in 1974, when issues like land reform and the formation of a
government accountable to the people were the rallying hue and cry all over Ethiopia.
The slogan ‘Land to the tiller’, for instance, was a powerful one in many parts of Ethiopia
and galvanized millions to embrace the revolution - but not in Tigrai, where anybody
could claim a piece of land under the rist system, which in a way was communal. There
was also widespread scepticism of changes that came from the centre and Tigraians
wanted to initiate changes by themselves and be masters of their own destiny. Because of
historical factors that lingered in Tigrai, the 1974 revolution did not arouse Tigraians as
much as it did other Ethiopians. So, revolution in Tigrai took its own, autonomous
course, focusing on achieving self-determination for the region.
In the rural areas of Tigrai, in farming and at celebrations of religious holidays or
wedding ceremonies, men and women alike made it routine to sing ‘blues’ or lamentation
songs that either expressed the dismal conditions they had to endure, or called for the
moment to rebel against the repressive system. In a predominantly peasant and illiterate
71society like Tigrai, ideas are usually communicated orally and expressed through songs
and poems. Two of the old but popular songs that reflected the feelings of anger were:
Tigrai kinday malti kitsebeyeki, (Tigrai, how long should I linger)
Ab maegerey geyre kimalaalki (Let me get ‘it’ [the gun] for you)
Gobez Tigrai! Gobez Tigrai! (Brave of Tigrai! Brave of Tigrai!)
Zebenka iu tsemede bieray! (Now it is your season to mount the ox/weapon)
Students on the other hand used to write, demonstrate, organize in study groups, and sing
songs of a revolutionary nature that were more straightforward and programmatic. It was
university students who took the lead in these revolutionary activities. Almost every
Tigraian, even the feudal lords and the clergy, who might have had to lose some of their
privileges after the revolutionary struggle, seemed to admire the call for self-
determination, the vision of the educated younger generation and their efforts to realize it.
It was in these circumstances that the TPLF emerged.
From TNO to TPLF
The core task set by the TNO was to prepare the groundwork for the armed struggle. All
TNO’s other activities revolved around this objective. University and high school
students, teachers and civil servants were all recruited as members of the TNO with the
aim of initiating armed struggle. Although all the members understood that the direction
of the TNO was to enter an armed movement, only the younger and more able ones were
advised to engage in mental and physical preparation for the protracted war ahead. They
were encouraged to read experiences of guerrilla movements in Algeria, China, Cuba,
Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau and Vietnam, and the endurance and revolutionary discipline
exhibited in these revolutions was emphasized. The older ones, on the other hand, were
advised to remain unnoticed and to work underground in government-held towns to back
72up the front. Recruiting and organizing the urban dwellers in cells and supplying them
with revolutionary equipment, collecting money and other necessary materials like
medicine, and stealing relevant information from the enemy camp were some of the tasks
assigned to them.
The other important task the TNO undertook was establishing a working
relationship with the Eritrean fronts, the EPLF and ELF, for practical reasons. Although
the EPLF claimed to be ‘more progressive’ than the ELF and the ELF likewise claimed to
be ‘more truly nationalist’ than the EPLF, the TNO considered both fronts as nationalist
organizations fighting for the independence of Eritrea. No research or formal discussion
was conducted to reach a position on the nature of the fronts and the future of Eritrea and
this view was adopted purely for pragmatic reasons, without serious consideration of the
consequences. TNO leaders focused only on the support they could gain from the
Eritrean fronts to facilitate their own struggle against the military regime in Ethiopia.
With its geographic proximity and similar language patterns, it was not difficult for
Tigraians to trace and contact ELF or EPLF fighters. Above all, Tigraians were
sympathetic towards Eritrean fighters, especially at the university where some of the
Eritrean students were trying to break the exclusionist nationalist stance and forge a
people’s movement all over Ethiopia. When the ELF was contacted, the response was not
completely positive because another Tigraian group, the TLF, lead by Yohannes Tekle-
Haimanot and Gebre-Kidan Asfaha had already established a working relationship with
the ELF and the TNO was a remote option at that time. Perhaps the ELF might also have
considered the TLF as truly nationalist for they had upheld the independence of Tigrai,
like the Eritreans. The response from the EPLF, on the other hand, was prompt and
positive. Two factors might have expedited this swift reply. Firstly, the EPLF must have
been aware that their arch rival, the ELF, had already established working relations with a
Tigraian front, the TLF, which could help expand its area of operation. And secondly, a
group of the founders of the EPRP were already in the field with the EPLF but their
73relationship was not very smooth because the former could not adopt a clear-cut position
on the question of Eritrean independence.
Communication by letter lasted for more than five months until Mehari Tekle
(Mussie), an EPLF fighter but a Tigraian by birth, finally appeared to facilitate matters,
meeting with two TNO representatives, Seyoum and Aregawi, on the outskirts of
Asmara. Initially, the TNO leaders thought Mussie was the contact person representing
the EPLF but in their first formal meeting they discovered that, with the consent of the
EPLF leadership, Mussie was coming to join the TNO and fight for the self-
determination of Tigrai. He also disclosed to the TNO leaders that many other Tigraians
who had been fighting on the side of the EPLF were keenly talking about an armed
struggle soon to commence in Tigrai and that they were eager to come to their region to
fight the enemy. It was usual for Tigraians who went to Eritrea in search of work to join
the Eritrean fronts to fight the government, which was seen as the cause of their misery.
Girmay Jabir, Iyassu Baga, Marta (Kahsa), Haile Portsudan and Kokeb Wodi-Aala were
just some of these fighters. As it later turned out, Mussie became a very important link in
many aspects, especially between the EPLF and the TNO at a critical time (the end of
1974) when the ELF and EPLF were fighting against each other to gain ground from the
demoralized and retreating government forces. The situation was otherwise very difficult
to handle for inexperienced TNO leaders in a territory they were not familiar with.
In the initial discussions with Mussie, the first issue of concern was military
training, as all the founders of the TNO, except for Sihul, had no military experience
whatsoever. TNO members, most of whom were university and high school students plus
a few teachers, were available at any time to engage in training. Mussie spoke with
certainty about how the EPLF was willing to train as many Tigraians as the TNO could
produce. He also made it clear that the EPLF leadership would like to see fewer student
trainees and more peasant trainees, the rationale being that peasants who were already
accustomed to hardship would be better able to endure the tough rural circumstances they
would find themselves in... TNO leaders were not convinced of this argument but as they
had no reason to oppose it, proceeded to find peasant trainees as well. The EPLF’s
74request to increase the recruitment of peasants for the future TPLF army was to neutralize
the educated element, which otherwise would keep on critically scrutinizing and
challenging the manner of leadership, as had been experienced in the 1973 Menkae33
incident.
It was not difficult to raise recruits for military training. Many were prepared to
take on challenges under the leadership of the TNO. In a matter of days a group was set
up to take the initial challenge. The first group selected for military training in the EPLF-
liberated area arrived in Asmara in January 1975. Among these future tegadelti (fighters)
were Abbay Tsehay, Hailu Mengesha, Sahle Abraha (Seye), Atsbaha Dagnew (Shewit),
Yohannes Gebre-Medhin (Walta), Tikue Woldu (Awealom) and Legesse (Meles)
Zenawi, Ethiopia’s current prime minister. They had to stay in hotels in Asmara for a few
days as the route to the EPLF field of operation, including Asmara itself, had suddenly
become a war zone and was unsafe to travel through unarmed. During this somewhat
tense situation, only Meles34 slipped away unnoticed from the group that was due to
move to the field whenever the situation normalized. Within a few days however, the
situation was calm and under the guidance of the veteran fighter Mussie, the group got
away from Asmara at night and two days later arrived at the nearest EPLF training camp,
Riesi Adi where they immediately started rigorous military training. In their books on the
TPLF, both John Young (1997) and Jenny Hammond (1999) vaguely indicate that Meles
Zenawi and Sibhat Nega were founders of the TPLF, but that is incorrect. Both Meles
and Sibhat joined the Front months after it had been established.
Back in Tigrai, Sihul and his brother Berhane Ayele (Fitewi) had taken on the task
of assembling peasant trainees in their district of Shire. Their recruitment campaign was
focused towards active and motivated peasants who could cope with the rigorous military
33 This was a crackdown on pro-democracy activists, who were labelled as Menkae (or ‘bats’), in
the EPLF.
34 According to Hailu Mengesha (a member of the group), a month later on their way with a
mission to Tigrai, Hailu and Abbay found Legese (Meles) Zenawi in an Italian billiards café in
Adi Quala, 75 km from Asmara, where his mother comes from. They demanded an explanation
for his retreat from his comrades in Asmara but Meles has had nothing to say about this matter to
this day.
75training required. Within three days, some thirty individuals from both peasant and urban
backgrounds, including a few students like Niguse Taye (Kelebet), had volunteered to
join those who had already started training in Eritrea. Agazi and Seyoum led this group
all the way from Tigrai to Eritrea across enemy-held territory. They joined the first group
and in less than three months all had done well in their training and were ready for
combat.
In the town of Enda-Selassie in Shire, with Sihul as their indispensable host, the
rest of the TNO members were organizing in order to declare the actual beginning of
their armed struggle in the countryside of Tigrai. For more than a week, most of the TNO
leadership (among them Sihul, Giday, Asfaha, Seyoum, Agazi, and Berihu) had been
discussing when, how and where to start the long-awaited war. On Sihul’s
recommendation, it was decided to start it from Dedebit as soon as possible. Other
colleagues who joined this group at this preparatory stage were Asgede (a former soldier
in the Ethiopian army), Kahsay Berhe (Misgina), Michael, Melay and Abraha. It was
believed the armed struggle should start before the ultra-nationalist TLF, the Ethiopian
‘Bolshevik’ EPRP, and the ‘monarchist’ EDU,35 who also were poised to fight the
Dergue from Tigrai, gained ground with the people.
The final preparations for the guerrilla campaign were concluded at Sihul’s home.
He made available three rifles and a fourth came from Giday who pilfered it from his
father in his absence. Field equipment and other logistics were either bought or collected
from members and supporters and assembled at Sihul’s house. Sihul's family prepared a
few days’ rations for the contingent that would march to Dedebit. The day before the
group’s departure, Sihul’s house looked like the military base of a small contingent. The
future guerrilla fighters dressed in khaki clothes suitable for the heat and the rough terrain
they would face. All wore shorts and temalatet (locally made sandals); most of them for
the first time, and everyone were provided with vital supplies weighing about 20 kg. A
35 The three fronts (TLF, EPRP and EDU) including the TPLF were working hard to gain ground
in Tigrai one before the other, so that they would secure easy access to the neighboring Eritrean
fronts which had well-established base areas not far from the border lines with Tigrai and gain
military backing.
76mule was bought to help carry extra but vital materials. At midnight on 18 February 1975
(11 Yekatit 1967 E.C.), Fitewi led the way out of the town, which was guarded by police
and government militia. The hours of darkness had been chosen for the contingent to
leave, to avoid an unwanted confrontation with government forces. The group headed
towards Dedebit, declaring the beginning of the armed struggle and the birth of the TPLF.
The journey to Dedebit, which is about 80 km from Shire and 900 km from Addis Ababa,
took two nights. Dedebit thus became the starting point and the initial base of the TPLF.
Summary
It was a Tigraian rebellious elite that took the bold initiative to inspire and mobilize the
Tigraian peasants and other disgruntled social classes to take up arms against the
repressive regime of Ethiopia. This elite was born amid the oppressive feudal and
traditional circumstances and military dictatorship in Ethiopia on the one hand, and the
world-wide emerging revolutionary fervour of the 1960s and 1970s. Its ideology and
method of struggle reflected the revolutionary tide of that era. Highly motivated as the
group was, its leading members constituted urban-based educated young revolutionaries
who were hitherto operating in a semi clandestine association called TNO. By invoking
ethno-nationalists sentiments that were grounded on historical memories and socio-
economic deprivations and using leftist rhetoric, they managed to create a revolutionary
atmosphere among various social groups that opted for radical change. This approach to
mobilization continued in a more robust manner after the armed struggle, bearing the
name of TPLF, was launched from the remote hills of Tigrai, Dedebit. In this manner, the
urban-based radical movement was abruptly transformed into one of revolutionary
guerrilla warfare, and it was locally embraced dismayed people that badly sought change.
No matter how severely repressive the Ethiopian regime was and how dismal the
condition of the people was, a protracted armed rebellion would not have been possible
without the young ‘vanguard’ activists who formed the TNO and later the TPLF. They
provided the theoretical basis and the organizational skill the struggle needed. As argued
77in Chapter 2, the revolutionary struggle depended not only on the structural preconditions
that kept down the people but also on political ‘actors committed to radical change’
(Colburn 1994) that the TPLF founders filled.
The TPLF’s slogans, propaganda and program on paper definitely looked
revolutionary and gave lofty hopes of change that attracted a great number of Tigraians
from all walks of life. Its main tactic of struggle was what was commonly known by
radicals of the developing world as ‘revolutionary guerrilla warfare’ (Sarkesian 1975). Its
founding leaders believed and made the people believe, as in other ‘national liberation’
movements that the revolutionary change would be achieved through the ‘barrel of the
gun’ (Shivji 1991) and the gun was used against any element considered ‘counter-
revolutionary’ and ‘standing in the way’. We have to note that although the TPLF used
the popular term ‘revolutionary’ persistently in its rhetoric and as an insignia of its
objectives, in practice, however, there was little that resembled the revolutionary aspect if
by revolution we mean fundamental (social, political, economic) change. This was
evident in its activities starting from the early stage of the struggle and more so as the
movement progressed and beyond. It will be discussed at length as we traverse the
history of the TPLF-led struggle and in particular as we consider in the forthcoming
chapters whether indeed the struggle was revolutionary or not.
78Chapter 4
Testing the Fire: the Launch of Guerrilla Warfare
Introduction
For an armed mass insurrection to take place requires a dedicated political elite that can
plan and lead the insurgent war against much stronger and well-established state armed
forces. The ups and downs of waging guerrilla warfare are not just a series of physical
and psychological confrontations with a stronger enemy, but also complex endeavours of
welding together elements of a socially stratified society to stand up in unison in support
of the movement that just started the war and without which the survival and growth of
the movement would be unthinkable. In this chapter we look into how and why the
‘revolutionary elite’ shifted its movement from the usual urban areas to the remotest parts
of the rural areas and also how, based on this revolutionary approach, it handled the
various internal as well as external difficulties that it encountered.
While in general the TPLF from its inception was armed with the Marxist
revolutionary thought, its theory of guerrilla warfare was by-and-large based on Maoist
principles. These were put to the test in the struggles in China, Cuba, Algeria, Vietnam,
Guinea-Bissau and elsewhere. Aware of these precedents, the TPLF tried to effectively
put revolutionary guerrilla warfare theory into practice in the rather different
circumstances of Tigrai. The ‘authoritative’ nature of the theory coupled with the iron
discipline required in military undertakings also led the TPLF to try and exert very strict
control over internal developments and confront external pressures head-on.
79Journey to Dedebit36
This chapter narrates the events during the first year of the TPLF’s struggle to create the
physical and social bases that would embrace it in the coming years. It was a year in
which its raison d’être was defined and explained and its influence was spreading.
The first year of the armed struggle was full of challenges, with numerous ups and
downs. Few moments were as exiting as the first day of the journey to Dedebit, with its
unfamiliar jungle for all the founding members of the TPLF except Sihul. Armed for the
first time, the group left Sihul’s house in Enda-Selassie in Shire at midnight when the
town was asleep. Police or militia guards on duty could have confronted the young
students, who did not even know how to carry a gun let alone aim one and shoot. At this
point, their only infallible tool was their unbridled confidence, but this would have been
ineffective in actual combat. Thanks to Berhane Ayele, who knew every corner of the
town and the guards’ patrol patterns, the group slipped through Enda-Selassie without
incident, which would have been disastrous both in terms of likely casualties and the
future of the front. Once the group reached the outskirts of the town, it met pre-arranged
peasant guides in strategic villages all the way to Dedebit. The peasant guides, like
Meley, were all relatives of Sihul.
They kept moving all night to avoid government forces that might have been seen
it assembling in Enda Selassie, but also because the temperature rose as they descended
from the highlands of Shire towards the lowlands of Dedebit. Walking during the day
would have been difficult for the young fighters. At daybreak, the group retired to the
jungle to rest, find water and avoid meeting passing peasants. Although they were
exhausted after walking all night and carrying field materials no less than 20 kg each,
there was joy and relief on their faces. There was the excitement of opening a new page
of armed struggle in order to turn the aspirations of Tigraians into a reality, and their
36 Dedebit is the initial base area of the TPLF where the armed struggle was launched for the first
time. It is located in one of the remote areas of the sub-district of Asgede, Shire-Enda Selassie,
Western Tigrai along the gorge of River Tekeze. The author of this study was part of the scene.
80readiness to pay any cost in its realization meant that they could bear the physical
discomfort of their harsh surroundings. The second night of the journey to Dedebit was
more debilitating, as temperatures were even higher and drinking water became scarce.
As they approached the southern side of Dedebit, they continued their journey during
daylight but found it hard to keep up the same pace in the unfamiliar circumstances. More
than once they had to chase a colony of monkeys from small pools of muddy water where
they wanted to drink. As the drained group of fighters was forcing itself to keep moving,
a sudden gunshot was heard close behind. Everybody was nervous but regained their
composure and kept up their normal pace. This first shot turned out to be nothing but a
trick planned by the experienced Sihul to test the group’s nerve. In the evening, they
reached the centre of Dedebit and then moved on into the hills where Sihul selected the
highest one as a temporary settlement area until the whole region had been surveyed.
Having cleared a part of the bush, they lay down to sleep on the hill with the sky and
bright stars above them.
Dedebit is a rugged hilly area stretching along the Tekeze River gorge and close to
the Tselimoye forest. With three months of rain during the Ethiopian ‘winter’ (June-
August), the area grows thick tropical bush that looks impenetrable. In some isolated
spots where the land is cultivable, a few seasonal farmers used to clear the bush to grow
cash crops like sesame to supplement their earnings. The other nine months of the year, it
is dry and extremely hot, with temperatures rising to 40 degrees Celsius and water
becoming scarce. Its rough and irregular bush makes the area the ideal sanctuary for
guerrilla fighters and in such terrain it is easy to get lost. To these beginners of the
guerrilla campaign though, it did not take long to get to know the terrain and get used to
guerrilla life. The will and readiness to overpower any hardship that guerrilla warfare
would entail was already there. Sleeping in the open and on the ground in this season
with falling rains was worse than the heat of the summer. Without shelter from the rain,
not only was sleep difficult, but also the group’s guns got wet and would be unusable
until they were greased again the next day. One other problem was maintaining the food
supply, that was usually, if not always, rations like parched corn and peas or ground
81wheat and sesame, which came from supporters in Shire-Enda Selassie, Sheraro and Mai-
Kuhli. Food was prepared in the most rudimentary way, such as putting instantly
prepared dough on a hot flat stone and which in a few minutes was ready for
consumption. When flat stones were not available, small hard balls of rocks were picked,
heated until they glowed and then each hot rock would be covered with dough and placed
near the fire. After the dough had received enough heat from the hot rocks inside and
glowing fire outside, it would be ready for consumption and could also be kept for
several days. This kind of food is called birkuta and is common among pastoralists. Wild
fruits and roots also served as food when the dry rations were finished. Hunting was
discouraged to preserve the wildlife but also to avoid traces of the guerrilla group’s
existence in the area.
In a matter of days most of these fresh fighters seemed to get used to the rough life
in the jungle and were prepared to take up serious engagements, of the kind they heard
from Algeria, Angola, Vietnam, Cuba, etc. Thus, guerrilla life started and was embraced
with passion by almost every one. Yet, this did not mean everybody was adjusting to the
guerrilla life at the same pace - one or two complained about the food or the night walks
and the physical endurance required in this self-imposed rough venture.
Training in Guerrilla Warfare
Military training was the top priority for these young fighters who knew little or nothing
about guns or how to set an ambush. Most of them had read about the Vietnam war and
about the Cuban and Algerian revolutions and, above all, about Mao’s guerrilla warfare.
Theories of revolutionary war had partly been acquired during their university years,
when there were even attempts of secret training in guerrilla tactics in the university
campus. In theory they knew about hit-and-run attacks, advance and retreat, ambush and
surprise, but not about the complexities of their practical application. In military
engagement the gap between mock fighting and real fighting is wide, but still wider is the
82theory and practice of this venture. In practical warfare everything counts, including the
objectives of war, armaments, moral and physical composure of the combatants,
intelligence, leadership qualities, terrain and the weather, and even the direction of the
wind.
These young fighters were however poised in every sense of the word to translate
their theory into practice. They put their theory together with the practical experience of
Sihul and Asgede Gebre-Selassie, a former corporal in the Ethiopian army, who joined
the group at the last minute as they headed for Dedebit. Asgede and Sihul organized and
led the training exercises. Every evening, the day’s training was evaluated collectively to
improve performance the next day. Although there was no formal organizational
structure, the modest Sihul was regarded as the leader of the group and had the final say
in the whole process. For two weeks they went through rigorous military training that
was typical of guerrilla warfare, combining informal, traditional and conventional aspects
of war. Most of them were suffering from bruises and cuts which were left to heal by
themselves, as medical aid was not available at that early stage of the struggle.
The next stage of training was long-distance walks during the day and at night in
the excruciating conditions of Dedebit. This arrangement was coupled with mastering the
terrain not only of Dedebit but also the sub-districts of Asgede and Adiabo where the
Tekeze River gorge runs through the western edge.37 The group would split in two and at
times into three groups for a few days to survey a specific area and regrouped to
exchange their findings and plan the next phase. These activities lasted for more than
three months and towards the end an additional scheme of visiting remote villages was
included. Among these were Adi Mohamedai, Tselimoy, Misgar Tekez, Shimelba and
Mai Kuhli. The heads of these villages were well-armed, strong figures and some of them
were renowned shiftas, like Alem Eshet, who could have inflicted grave damage on the
small TPLF band. But thanks to Sihul’s influence, they would not contemplate this. Alem
Eshet of Tselimoy and Osman of Misgar Tekeze had gone as far as providing feasts for
the whole TPLF group by slaughtering an ox and a goat as a sign of respect in the
37 These areas were the haven of all kinds of shiftas (criminal or social bandits).
83traditional way. Later on, as the contacts with these villages became well-established and
peasants were organized in line with the TPLF’s political agenda and parallel to the
village heads’ network, they became the source of vital information and logistical help.
Whenever government agents approached them for information about the front, it was
customary for the peasants to disorient the agents by exaggerating the number of rebels as
‘countless like the hair’. In Misgar Tekeze, women like Woizero Tsehaytu, later better
known as ‘Mother’ by TPLF fighters, were ardent supporters of the TPLF from the
beginning. The double mobilization process of the TPLF – Tigraian nationalism to
mobilize all the people and the class ideology to organize the poor – had already started
manifesting itself even at this initial stage of the struggle.
The mobility of the TPLF to Wolkait, across the River Tekeze in the west and to
the larger villages of Sheraro, Bademe, Adi Awala and Adi Nebried in the northeast
continued without serious impediment. Indeed, there were no meaningful government
forces in these areas and the few scattered ones seemed to prefer co-existence with the
front.
At this early stage of the struggle, news of the tiny front was spreading like
wildfire not only in the villages but also in the big towns and cities, including Meqele, the
capital of Tigrai, and even Addis Ababa. Several young people began to flow to the front,
although it was not simple to trace the location of the constantly mobile guerrilla fighters.
Formerly associated members, among them Wolde-Selassie Nega (Sibhat) and Legese
Zenawi (Meles)38 who were later to play a controversial role both in the Front and later in
the government they controlled, also joined the TPLF at this time.39 They all had to pass
the military training, which was not yet fully developed but enough to give confidence
and provide the basic know-how of fighting.
While the number of the fighters increased, there were no arms available except
for the initial four outdated rifles that everybody was anxious to get hold of. The
expectation that the contingent under training in the EPLF in Eritrea would come with
38 For brief profiles of both Meles and Sibhat, see Appendix 3.
39 For details, see Aregawi Berhe 2004.
84enough weapons to arm the Dedebit group was still high. The scarcity of weapons did not
however deter this group from carrying on with training and executing necessary
missions in the whole district of Shire. Meanwhile it was decided that a delegation should
be sent to the ELF, which was operating in nearby Bademe, not just to look for arms but
also to establish lasting contact with them. Asfaha, a founding member of the TPLF, and
Meles were assigned to accomplish this mission but it was aborted when they reached
Bademe because of trivial disagreements that erupted between them for which they
blamed each other. Another delegation had to take up the mission and it managed to
establish contact but never was the contact as cordial as that with the EPLF, since the
ELF was committed to another Tigraian group, the TLF.
Without adequate arms and with self-improvised training schemes, the first group
in Dedebit completed the basic military exercises that would enable it to wage guerrilla
warfare. The whole group became confident about defending itself or even attacking an
advancing enemy detachment with the meagre arms it possessed. More military training
was expected when the contingent from Eritrea returned.
The Contingent’s40 Return from Eritrea
In the EPLF, military training conditions were no less harsh than in Dedebit, but the
experience and quality of the training was far more advanced. It was well-established and
structured, supported by ample reading materials and the necessary weapons for practice.
There were also qualified instructors trained in the Ethiopian military academy, or in
Syria and China. The experience gained in fourteen years of guerrilla warfare against the
Ethiopian government was the equivalent of that in a military college. In early 1975,
when the Tigraian contingent arrived in Eritrea for training, the EPLF was already
engaged in pitched battles with Ethiopian government forces in the vicinity of Asmara
40 As mentioned earlier, the contingent was sent to the EPLF-held territory in Eritrea for military
training a month before the TPLF was launched in Dedebit in February 1975.
85and at times inside the city itself. The city was besieged for months. The bulk of the
EPLF forces and their logistical supply were placed to serve this frontline. The training
for this group had to take place not far from the war zone where continuous air raids and
heavy artillery bombardment made their days miserable. Equally miserable were the
chilly weather and the lack of water, which had to be fetched from deep gorges that were
not easily accessible even when not carrying jerrycans full of water.
In addition to the TPLF group, an EPRP group led by Berhanemeskel Redda that
made its way from abroad and the Assefa-Hailu Habtu group who joined them from
Addis Ababa were in the same area to undergo military training. The stay of the Habtu
group in the EPLF area was short-lived as they had a serious dispute with the
Berhanemeskel group - which later became the core of EPRP - over the strategy of their
struggle and later with the EPLF over their attitude towards the nature of the Ethiopian
revolution and went into exile abroad. The EPRP group however persisted with their
training although they too had differences with the EPLF on the issue of the Eritrean
quest for independence.
In the course of their training, the TPLF group took the initiative of contacting the
EPRP group, so that a working relationship could be established. This initiative was
communicated though the EPLF to the EPRP but they rejected the offer, claiming that a
party such as the EPRP should not lower its status by talking to a nationalist front. This
negative response was the beginning of a rocky relationship between the two
organizations that ultimately ended in armed conflict. The differences that led to the
conflict were basically related to the treatment of the ethno-national question in multi-
ethnic Ethiopia.
When the training course came to an end, it was time to approach the EPLF
leadership for arms so that every TPLF member could carry a weapon. The reality
however did not meet everyone’s expectations. The request for arms was made before the
training came to a close, but nothing was forthcoming. Then, a second and a third
requests were forwarded after the training was completed, but still no arms were made
available. The young Tigraian fighters who had completed training began counting the
86days and later weeks in idleness. Fighters like Ahferom started to complain loudly,
insisting that if only they had joined their comrades in Dedebit, with whatever was
available there, they could have snatched more arms from the enemy than the EPLF
could offer. Finally, Mussie was sent to Isayas Afeworki, then vice general-secretary, to
make a direct complaint. Isayas gave orders to his aide-de-camp that a few rifles
collected from a nearby camp be given to the Tigraians. With Mussie’s efforts, some ten
rifles (2 Kalashnikovs, 8 various semi- and non-automatic rifles) and 3 hand grenades
were collected and handed to the Tigraian contingent - useful, but still a pittance.
Although they were expecting enough automatic rifles to arm their comrades in Dedebit
as well, the contingent did not want to waste any more time looking for arms.
Immediately after they secured these few rifles, they began their long-awaited journey
back to Tigrai. A few other Tigraians, former EPLF fighters like Yemane Kidane
(Jamaica), Girmay Jabir, Dirfo, Wodi Ala and Kokeb joined this group to fight in Tigrai.
At the time of departure, the contingent’s numbers rose to 21 fighters but only half of
them were armed with the few rifles they had managed to acquire.
In mid-May, this contingent of 21 fighters arrived in the district of Shire in Tigrai,
but they did not know the exact location of Dedebit where those who launched the armed
struggle could be found. On the advice of Alemayehu Gessesew (Dirar), Sihul’s youngest
brother, who was part of the peasant group that had undertaken training in Eritrea, the
contingent headed to Hirmi, an extended gorge near the village of Kelakil, where most of
Sihul’s close relatives lived. From Kelakil, it was not difficult to trace the Dedebit group
through Sihul’s family network. As the message reached the Dedebit group, it wasted no
time in making the three-day journey to Hirmi to join the contingent that came back from
military training in Eritrea.
With a lot of excitement on both sides, the two groups met at Hirmi and formed a
company of 43 combatants. There was great jubilation and for the next four to five days
almost everybody was given time to relax and share their experiences of the first four
months of the TPLF and the EPLF. Since Hirmi was not too far from the village of
Kelakil, the fighters would go to the village in groups to mingle and socialize and also to
87get homemade food (injera) and drinks (siwa or tella, local beer). It was on one such
occasion, while a group that included Asfaha, Yemane, Sibhat and Aregawi were
ascending through the cliffs of Hirmi to go to Kelakil, that the aim of the Tigrai struggle
was raised by Sibhat, in a joking manner. Known for his jokes, he propounded that it
could be regarded as a ‘colonial question’, like that of the Eritreans. Some of them
ridiculed Sibhat’s overture, asking ‘…where on earth are you going to cook up the
history and politics to justify it’. All laughed but not Sibhat, who felt insulted. Nobody
took what seemed to have come up in informal jest as a serious position. This was a
mistake, for the same position would appear in different forms later during the struggle,
and was to have a disruptive impact not only in the Tigraian movement for self-
determination but also later in Ethiopian power politics in general.
After the launch of the TPLF in February 1975, the whole leadership (eight
founders of the organization, namely Sihul, Agazi, Giday, Hailu, Abbay, Seyoum,
Asfaha, and Aregawi) met in June at Hirmi for the first time. With all the developments
in the previous five months, they had to work out short- and long-term plans for the
struggle ahead. Settling Mussie’s status was top of their agenda. Considering his long
experience in struggles and his crucial role in the relationship with the EPLF, they
decided to incorporate Mussie in the leadership. At first, Mussie looked surprised when
he heard the arrangement of including him, but he could only accept it. So with the
consensus of the entire leadership, Mussie became the ninth member of the TPLF
leadership until the first congress of all fighters that was held in Deima, Agame a year
after the founding of the TPLF.
The main issues of concern at this point were restructuring the organization,
assigning new tasks and obtaining additional military training that would enable every
fighter to cope with the realities of guerrilla warfare and work towards bringing down the
oppressive system for the benefit of Tigrai. Initially, the whole organization’s structure
was a simple military formation with the idea of waging the guerrilla warfare for the
years to come. The company of 43 combatants formed three squads of 14 to 15 men. At a
brief meeting that did not last even half an hour, the leadership elected Sihul as the
88chairman, Mussie as military commander and Aregawi as commissar, with the other
leadership members heading a squad as commander and commissar. With this formation,
it was decided to undertake intensive military and political training that would bring the
Dedebit and EPLF-trained group to the same level. For this purpose and to lay out a
comprehensive plan for the next phase of the struggle, Dedebit was again selected as the
ideal place to accomplish these tasks. So everybody had to march to Dedebit once again.
However, unforeseen circumstances began to emerge in Dedebit. The peasant
fighters, most of who had prior knowledge of managing rifles and were better acquainted
with life in the bush were dissatisfied with the reorganization and appointments that
followed. They began to regroup secretly, which eventually led to the first crisis within
the TPLF.
Crisis Creeps In
The reorganization, which was accompanied by intensive military and political training,
had not brought anything dramatic. Everybody seemed to be focused on training to
launch attacks on the enemy. By taking the initiative and the leading role, the founders of
the TPLF were just doing what was regarded as a normal process of setting up a politico-
military front to fight an aggressive state regime. The Front was in the process of shaping
itself and taking the form a political organization should possess. Interestingly enough, all
the members of the front warmly welcomed the inclusion of Mussie into the leadership,
perhaps because everybody realized the role he had played so far and his potential in the
future. Evidently, there had been opportune moments to observe the experienced Mussie,
while the inexperienced ‘student leaders’ were yet to be tested. In the eyes of the peasant
fighters however, the issue of the student leaders turned out to be a rallying point for their
grievances and subsequent actions.
Major decisions were made by the leadership at this period. One was to move the
base area from Dedebit to the central Tigrai area where other Ethiopian fronts, namely
89the EPRP and the TLF were operating. It would then be easier to hold political discourse
with the fronts on issues of common interest and coordinate forces to fight the common
enemy. The other significance of this area was its accessibility and proximity to the
Eritrean fronts, in particular to the EPLF from whom considerable military assistance and
weapons were expected to come. A second decision was to assign two groups composed
of members of the leadership to survey the next transitory base area to central Tigrai and
to travel to the EPLF base area to request the leadership for arms. When the plan to move
the base from Dedebit to central Tigrai was disclosed to the fighters, the peasants from
this area were against it. They thought that if they left the territory they were familiar
with, their role and hence the weight of their influence would decrease. From this point
on, they became engaged in clandestine activities.
Even before this divergence of views occurred, the peasant fighters were not
content with the student leaders. In their first encounter with them, they felt they were a
group of clumsy schoolboys who ‘could only play with paper’ and not shoulder the heavy
burden of armed struggle. The peasants thought the struggle was just a military campaign
and that they were in a better position than the students to handle it. For them, a leader
meant someone who could lead them in battle. They believed themselves to be battle-
tested heroes considering the number of shots they fired in their villages or in the bush.
They seriously thought battles tested and determined who one was and that the political
or propaganda work was just a waste of time or the work of a weak person. They also did
not like the idea of collective leadership which placed the students on the same level as
them and more so with Sihul, who they considered was the sole leader and should remain
to be seen as such. The notion of equality, which was brought up by the young students
and began to be entertained in the front, was unacceptable to them. They did not want the
traditional relationship, which they considered a better one, to be eroded. With these
feelings, they started creating a separate circle that undermined the organizational
structure that had not yet had time to mature. Alemayehu Gessesew (Dirar) was at the
centre of this disgruntled group. Perhaps, his dream was to make sure his eldest brother
90Sihul remain as a dominant leader and he himself became the second or third in
command. Dirar’s dream was definitely contrary to Sihul’s revolutionary convictions.
Dirar was no ordinary peasant, nor were his closest associates. They were people
who made their living in both urban and rural areas. During the rainy season they went to
their farms and then they came to town to look for work or to engage in petty trade. Some
of them could also have been involved in criminal shiftinnet, which was common in those
days in that region. This pariah group was engaged in secret talks for days and nobody
seemed to understand what it was all about. Gradually it became clear that the group was
dissatisfied with the leadership most of which happened to be young students, but at that
early stage of the struggle it was hard to imagine that they were plotting to eliminate the
leaders of the organization still in its infancy.
As Kahsay Berhe41 explained the events, it was at lunchtime one day that they
were to execute their plan. Tsegay Tesfay (Kokab) who happened to be the cook that day
detected an unfamiliar regrouping and movement among the peasants. He then found that
Sihul, who normally sat with the student group for lunch, was away on a mission. Again
he noticed the peasants were not converging on the lunch site but instead were moving
around to positions favourable to aiming and shooting. He altered the customary way of
sitting for lunch and dispersed the likely targets of the peasants’ plot. Now that their
intended targets had been dispersed, the peasant plotters for their part were confused by
their own strange rearrangement. Their plan was messed up and they were unable to
execute their assault. Thanks to Kokab, the plot was aborted. Their plan, as was revealed
later on, was to kill the student leaders, except for Sihul and Mussie. That same day,
about ten of the arch plotters, including Dirar, Meftuh and Hiluf, fled the scene never to
return. To the embarrassment of all the committed fighters, they took with them some of
the rifles the organization depended on for its defence, training and future activities. A
state of confusion and uncertainty reigned. Everybody seemed to suspect the other of
plotting to kill or run away with the guns. A night passed with everyone watching each
other, and the next day an emergency general meeting of all the fighters was called to
41 Interview: Kahsay Berhe, Münster, Germany, 27 March 2004.
91resolve the first crisis in the organization, which was then termed as Hinfishfish (chaos).
At the meeting, the plotters’ conspiracy was revealed by some of the peasant fighters who
had been trailing them. Some cried bitterly while relating what had happened. At the end
of the day a decision was made to give all the peasant fighters a second chance. They
were allowed to remain in the organization as long as they abided by its principles or they
had to leave peacefully. A few who could not cope with the stiff revolutionary discipline
left, but also left all the front’s belongings behind.
With the first Hinfishfish as a backdrop, the leadership met to assess the situation
and to rekindle the mood of enthusiasm about fighting the Dergue that had originally
been prevalent among most members. It did not take much time or effort to regenerate the
fighting spirit. The two crucial missions mentioned earlier were immediately launched.
But again, in just two weeks time, both missions – the movement to the centre and the
trip to Eritrea – were foiled by tragic incidents that befell Sihul and Mussie.
Government militia in Adi Daero caught Mussie, who belonged to the delegation
to Eritrea, as he entered the small town to buy food and cigarettes. As soon as the other
members of the delegation, Seyoum and Yemane, learned about the incident, they fled to
the base area to report back and seek help. But before a rescue attempt could be made,
Mussie was transported to Enda-Selassie in Shire where there was a police garrison.
There he was chained and locked in a cell awaiting orders to be transported to Meqele or
Addis Ababa. The other group on mission, which was being led by Sihul and was not far
away from the Mussie group, learned from peasants that Mussie had fallen into the hands
of the enemy and been taken to Enda-Selassie prison. Sihul, together with the other
members of the group, Gebremichael and Awalom decided to rescue Mussie by storming
the prison in Enda-Selassie. A very daring resolution! The three of them hurried off to
Enda-Selassie but were compelled to stop at the River Chiameskebet due to flooding.
Worse still, Sihul was swept away by the river flooded by heavy rainstorms as he
attempted to cross it. Fortunately, he was thrown out of the river alive but he had serious
injuries and was taken to a supporter’s house to recuperate. Their intended mission was
aborted. The front appeared to have entered a difficult, testing period; nevertheless, the
92other determined fighters were there to propel the fight forward, as exhibited days later in
the raid on Shire Police Station.
Storming Shire Police Station
News of the tragic incidents struck the base area when Yemane and Seyoum returned
after they lost their comrade Mussie to the Dergue agents in Adi Daero. Everybody was
shocked and became restless; proposing a contingent be hurriedly dispatched to Enda-
Selassie to rescue him. Everyone showed readiness to be part of the first risky mission
since the TPLF’s formation. In no time, a squad of eleven combatants42 was formed and
hurried to rescue Mussie before he was taken to a bigger garrison where it would be
impossible even to attempt a rescue operation. It was early August and the rain was
falling incessantly day and night hindering mobility and disabling the few rifles picked
for the operation. Rain coupled with darkness made the squad’s journey of what should
have been a day take almost two days. One could hardly see through the dark and yet
night time was preferred for the operation, because the inadequate number of combatants
and their limited arms were no match for the force in Enda Selassie. Darkness could help
camouflage them.
At 02:00 h. on 5 August 1975 (29 Hamle 1967 E.C.) the squad stormed the prison
and in an operation that took about 20 minutes, Mussie and about sixty other prisoners
were freed from their cells without being injured. Caught completely by surprise, the
police guards fled their posts, leaving one of their colleague wounded. Right away, the
TPLF squad with Mussie in its midst swiftly headed for Hirmi, the nearest gorge and now
familiar territory for all the members of the squad. After resting in Hirmi for a couple of
days, the squad made the long journey to Widak close to the Mereb River. In Widak, the
bigger contingent that had started moving to the central region from Dedebit was
awaiting to regroup with hit squad.
42 The author of the present study was one of the combatants in the Enda-Selassie operation.
93This highly risky first operation by the TPLF came at a precarious time for the
front. The front was not prepared either in assault skills or in arms to undertake incidental
combat. The success of this imposed operation therefore turned out to be a memorable
event that influenced the future course of the TPLF. It was the first successful operation
since the founding of the Front, and as a result, an important figure in the organization
was rescued from the hands of the enemy. The misgivings lingering in the organization
seemed to have been removed, or at best the feeling that no mishap would deter the Front
from ever growing was implanted in every member’s mind. What was feared to be a
negative if not a humiliating precedence turned out to be a glorious victory and boosted
the morale of the fighters and their sympathizers. All of a sudden, the TPLF became
known all over Tigrai, and in the enemy quarters, it was seen as a force to be reckoned
with. The implication of this first victory both inside and outside the organization was
way beyond what could be comprehended at this stage of the struggle.
The emergence of a Tigraian front that could defeat a government force opened up
new horizons in the hitherto repressed mentality of Tigraians. To many people the future
seemed promising and led them to embrace and pursue the path the TPLF had initiated. It
was precisely because of this reinvigorated feeling in the front that the aborted mission to
the EPLF field in search of arms was ignored and instead an operation that could enable
the Front to procure arms and money from the enemy became the priority. This resolve
led to the Aksum operation a month later.
The Aksum Operation
Unlike the storming of Enda-Selassie police garrison, there was no urgency or
compulsion that led to the operation in Aksum. It was carefully thought out and
meticulously planned and conducted in broad daylight at 16:00 h. on the afternoon of 4
September 1975. The Aksum operation had multiple purposes that included the
procurement of money and arms – so badly needed to keep the growing front on the
94move – and publicity, which that was no less important at the time in terms of generating
public awareness and support.
The ancient historical town of Aksum43 (see also Chapter 1) is one of Ethiopia’s
most famous tourist attractions, and had a bank and a police garrison much larger than
that in Enda Selassie. Although it would not be easy, it was thought that the success of
this operation would have a big impact on the future development of the front. Besides
the relatively big force in the town, the 10th ground battalion of the government army was
stationed at Adwa, 20 km east of Aksum. A swift advance by this battalion to Aksum
would have definitely foiled the planned operation had the radio and telephone
communications not been cut beforehand. A clandestine member of the TPLF, Abadi
Mesfin, a health officer and head of the Aksum Hospital at the time, was at the centre of
the operation’s technical arrangements from within this government-held town. Hailu
Mengesha served as liaison person between the field and the clandestine units in the
town.
Unnoticed because of their camouflage, fourteen guerrilla fighters pretending to be
local peasants from the eastern part of the town regrouped and dashed through Aksum in
a Land Rover that had been requested just minutes earlier from the health centre,
ostensibly to provide emergency assistance. The squad split into two groups: one to go to
the police garrison led by Mussie, the other to the bank led by Aregawi. With negligible
resistance and in a matter of minutes, both the police garrison and the bank fell into the
hands of TPLF fighters. Three police officers in the garrison and one at the bank were
killed in the shoot-out while one TPLF fighter was slightly wounded. Substantial
amounts of arms and ammunition and Birr 175,000 (US$ 84,000) were collected in the
raid.
As the sound of gunshots subsided and the squad began withdrawing from the
town, the people of Aksum, especially the youth cheered the TPLF fighters, from their
windows and balconies. It was a clear indication that the TPLF had already found a space
in the minds and hearts of the people and the message of the Enda-Selassie operation was
43 For further details, refer to Yuri M. Kobishchanov, Axum, 1966.
95well received. With their booty loaded into the Land Rover, the squad immediately
retired to a nearby village that was accessible by car. From there, the men had to carry
most of the things by themselves and some on the backs of donkeys purchased from
peasants and taken to Medebai near the River Mereb.
Since Aksum was – and still is – a well-known historical and religious town in
Ethiopia, news of the raid reached not only every corner of the country but also the
European press. TPLF fighters rejoiced as they heard the news of their operation over the
BBC and German Radio (Deutsche Welle - Amharic service). This made them believe
their cause was gathering recognition outside their country and reinforced their
determination to pursue it. The fact that the European news media showed interest in the
Aksum operation by the still-unknown TPLF, even in Ethiopia, has to be seen in the
context of the Cold War. At this time, the government in power was a self-proclaimed
Marxist junta, called Dergue, that was establishing ties with Communist China and the
Soviet Union – ties that the West did not espouse for years to come.
The government, on the other hand, chose to downplay the resounding impact of
the Aksum operation as an act of isolated shiftas. Yet, it proceeded to organize military
campaigns aimed at sweeping away what it termed the ‘bush mouse’, i.e. the TPLF, with
the further intent of destroying the ‘bandits’ in Eritrea. The Dergue’s dream was too
ambitious for it had only been in government for a year and had begun to implement
unpopular policies among a population where sympathy lies with locally born rebel
forces. The Dergue was unable to observe its subjective and objective limitations,
especially in the northern part of Ethiopia where rebellion against the central government
was raging openly in Eritrea and under the surface in Tigrai. From then on, TPLF
guerrilla units continued their surprise attacks and ambushes on isolated stationary or
mobile government forces and at the same time created an area under their sphere of
control. Once the movement entered the guerrilla phase, its central objective was not
simply to isolate the enemy but also, as Ahmad put it, ‘…to confirm, perpetuate, and
institutionalize it by providing an alternative to the discredited regime through the
creation of ‘parallel hierarchies’’ (in Miller and Aya 1971: 157). In such a manner and
96with the all-round support of the poor peasants their area of operation in central and
eastern Tigrai broadened.
Encounter with the TLF
The TLF initially started as a clandestine urban-based movement under the name of
Mahber Politica Degaru (Political Association of Tigraians) in the early 1970s. Its
leaders were two university graduates, historian Yohannes Tekle-Haimanot and Gebre-
Kidan Asfaha, who was a chemist. Some sources indicate that Yohannes Tekle-
Haimanot, Amare Tesfu and Giday Gebre-Wahid formed the TLF in late 1972 but
whether this is true or not, the fact remains that before the organization declared its
existence, Amare was eliminated by the organization he was creating and Giday was
executed by the ruling Dergue, leaving the responsibility of leadership to Yohannes and
Gebre-Kidan. Unlike most politicized university youth, these two Mahber Politica
leaders were not seen as real participants in the revolutionary Ethiopian students’
movement of the day. The reason for their withdrawal from the Ethiopian students’
movement became clearer later, when they issued their position paper on the question of
Tigrai, known as Kiya Tigrai (History of Tigrai). In Kiya Tigrai, they stated that Tigrai
had never been an independent entity from the rest of Ethiopia and implied that their
struggle was meant to realize this position. Apart from this locally disseminated paper,
very little was known of the organization’s activities at that time.
The TLF’s contact with the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) on the other hand
appears to have started in the early 1970s, long before it emerged as a front. It was during
this time that some revolutionary nationalist individuals like Tekeste Wubneh, Mussie
Kidane and Amare Tesfu from the ranks of the Ethiopian students’ movement joined
them. This group, however, was soon to find itself at odds with Yohannes’s group which
had a long-standing relationship with TLF leaders like Melake Tekle. While the TLF as
an organization had strong and cordial relations with the ELF, it had no relationship with
97the EPLF, which at the time had already established some sort of working relationship
with the Ethiopian Left. The TLF appeared determined to demonstrate their Tigraian
ultra-nationalist stance by keeping a distance from the EPLF, which was showing some
efforts to accommodate the Ethiopian Left. In fact, at times it rallied with the ELF in
condemning the EPLF of harbouring Ethiopian revolutionaries who they thought would
forge a multinational leftist party that might unite the Eritrean and Ethiopian
revolutionaries under one banner.
Knowing the advantage of maintaining working relations with both the Eritrean
fronts and that the ELF was harbouring the TLF, the TPLF still kept on knocking on the
ELF’s doors. For obvious reasons, the ELF was never enthusiastic about its relations with
the TPLF. Association with the EPLF was also not dependable, for the EPLF continued
to adore the general Ethiopian Left of which the EPRP was their most favourite. There
was a remote hope, however, that by forging unity with the TLF and by extension, a good
relationship with the ELF would develop.
For practical reasons, even before the TPLF moved to the central Tigrai region, it
had established contacts with the TLF while the latter was making occasional
appearances in Tigrai from its initial base in the ELF-held territory. In October 1975, the
TPLF took the initiative to establish formal contact with the TLF and invited the
organization to send its delegates to the TPLF area of operation for an introductory
meeting. Yemene Gebre-Meskel and Gebru Bezabih were entrusted by the TLF with that
task and came to the TPLF area for a couple of days to get acquainted and conduct a
series of discussions with the leadership and all TPLF members. The discussions covered
a range of topics, among which three remained unsettled. These three main differences
with the TLF were:44
44 For a broader understanding of the differences and the subsequent clash between the two
organizations that led to the elimination of the TLF, see TPLF, ‘Fitsametat-Woyyanena’ (in
Tigrigna, 1978 E.C.), pp. 99-104. Also in a leaflet that was distributed throughout Tigrai
immediately after the incident, the TPLF had informed the public about the inside story of the
TLF and the measures taken by the TPLF.
98- The nature and scope of the Tigraian national movement, which the TLF put as a
struggle for independence, while the TPLF considered itself to be a movement for self-
determination. This contentious issue brought into the picture individuals within the
TPLF, like Sibhat Nega, who held similar positions to those of the TLF but were unable
to articulate or substantiate them and hence were forced to keep a low profile.
- The setting up of the leadership, which for the TPLF had to be elected by the front’s
members, while TLF leaders were simply replaced by the top leaders when the need
arose.
- The conditions of prominent fighters, like Amare Tesfu, Mussie Kidane and Tekeste
Wubneh, whose whereabouts had become mysterious since they joined the TLF.
Although an atmosphere of cordiality and the wish to become one stronger
organization existed, these unresolved issues pending higher level meetings definitely left
some unfinished business between them. However, both sides emphasized the need to
forge unity between the two fronts and to fight the common repressive system
represented by the Dergue. The two visitors from the TLF returned with positive feelings.
A higher-level meeting was agreed upon for the following month, once the TPLF had
established a permanent base in the eastern part of Tigrai.
The TPLF continued its march to the east and in early November 1975 it
established a temporary base area at Zegebla in the district of Agame to where the TLF
was invited by the TPLF to conclude the unity agreement. By the time the TLF and its
top leaders had reached Zegebla where the TPLF was stationed, an unexpected
development had arisen: the TLF had been split into three factions, one led by Yohannes
Tekle-Haimanot, the second by gerazmach Kahsay Dori and his brother Subagadis Dori,
and the third by Dejen Tessema. While the whereabouts of the second and third groups
were shrouded in secrecy at that time, only the group led by Yohannes came to Zegebla
to deliberate and conclude the agreement of unity.
The news of their split ran between TPLF fighters as it reached them from fleeing
fighters, among them Haile Sobia and Wodi Sebaa, who were disgusted by the causes
that triggered the division in the TLF. It was reported that the main cause of the split was
99the criminality of Yohannes’s group, which dominated the organization. They were
alleged to have had about seventeen fighters killed who were thought to be standing in
the way or were seen as potential opponents. No comprehensible or sound reason for the
alleged killings transpired. Among the victims were prominent nationalist
revolutionaries, like Amare Tesfu, Mussie Kidane, Sied Mohammed Tiam and Tekeste
Wubneh. The killings of these nationalist revolutionaries were secretly executed. This
tragic story infuriated all TPLF fighters who demanded that the process of unity with the
TLF be halted and measures taken to clarify the situation. In the TPLF, Sibhat Nega,
Yemane Kidane and Meles Zenawi, without the consent of the leadership, took the lead
in encouraging the fighters to take immediate measures against the TLF. They also
accused the TPLF leadership of engaging the organization in a process of unity with
bandits of the criminal type. They even coined a slogan that ran: ‘It is better to unite with
Hawelti Aksum (i.e. the Aksum stelae, an inanimate object) than with such reactionaries’.
The TPLF leadership had no option but to call an emergency meeting and discuss
how to handle this delicate matter that had the potential of bringing serious disruption in
both camps or even of triggering a bloody conflict between the two fronts. After a
lengthy debate, the TPLF leadership unanimously decided to take the less risky measure
of physically overpowering and disarming the TLF fighters, who numbered less than a
third in number of TPLF fighters. This was the safest way to tackle the crisis that divided
the TLF and had left the TPLF in shock. It was arranged in such a way that three or four
TPLF fighters and one TLF fighter would constitute a unit within a squad and leave for
the trenches where they would sleep at night in the normal guerrilla formation during rest
hours. Then early in the morning of 11 November 1975, a secret signal, which was only
given to the TPLF fighters, would alert them to pin down the TLF fighters and snatch
their weapons. As the ratio of TLF-TPLF fighters was one to three or four, it was
believed this tactic was the most efficient and likely to cause the least or no bloodshed. It
was carried out as planned, but two of the TLF fighters were killed in a skirmish that got
out of hand in two of the units, as the two attempted to escape violent arrest and were
100confronted by panic-stricken fighters.45 Sadly, one of the fighters who lost his life in the
unexpected skirmish was Yemane Gebre-Meskel who had led the TLF delegation to the
TPLF a few months earlier. The others were all arrested without further casualties.
The same morning, a meeting of all the TPLF fighters and the arrested TLF
members was called and the whole purpose of the operation was discussed. In the
afternoon, each TLF member was asked two key questions: Why did the split arise? And
where are the other seventeen prominent fighters? All fingers pointed to Yohannes Tekle-
Haimanot and his close associates Gebre-Kidan Asfaha, Tefera Kassa, Taddesse Tilahun,
and Yemane Gebre-Meskel, including the absentees Desta Tesfay and Hailekiros Aseged
as ‘people with sinister motives’ who had caused the fighters’ disappearance. When the
leaders were asked about these missing fighters, they did not hesitate but announced it
was for ‘political reasons’. What this meant, however, was not clear except that
Yohannes’s group, which had the upper hand in the organization, was uncomfortable
with their general attitude. They all testified without exception that Amare Tesfu in
Meqele, Mussie Kidane in Addis Ababa, Tekeste Wubneh in Eritrea (ELF territory), Sied
Mohammed Tiam in Gundagunde, Tigrai, had been killed. So, except for the few leaders
who admitted responsibility for the crimes, there was no reason to hold the other fighters
as prisoners. The same day, the majority of the TLF fighters were set free and given the
chance either to reorganize the TLF or start afresh the unity process, or join the TPLF on
an individual basis or go to any place of their choice. A lot of them joined the TPLF and
some left to go home but the idea of reorganizing the TLF was buried with Yohannes and
Taddesse, who were later executed by the TPLF for their acts. Tefera Kassa escaped from
prison, thus avoiding any kind of punishment.
Before a final decision on the fate of the two imprisoned TLF leaders was reached,
the TPLF leadership invited the ELF and the EPLF to send delegates to look into the
delicate criminal case of the TLF and share their views as to how it should be handled.
45 Berhe Hagos, who was present during the incident and who later abandoned the TPLF,
remarked that the inexperienced and nervous fighters who fired at the two victims were partly to
blame. Interview: Berhe Hagos, Ottawa, 27 August 2008.
101Delegates of both Eritrean fronts came up to Deima, the TPLF territory, and conducted
their own independent investigation by discussing the matter with the two TLF leaders.
Finally, they arrived at the same conclusion as the TPLF leaders had earlier. Both
delegates concluded that Yohannes’s group had committed crimes against their own
colleagues for reasons that were not acceptable by any measure.46 No one could figure
out why at the earliest stage of their struggle they should first turn on their comrades
while there was a common enemy out there. The ELF delegates were also annoyed by the
revelation of their colleagues’ collaboration in some of the killings. The fact that some of
the TLF fighters were killed in their own territory and that the execution of two TLF
members had been carried out by ELF fighters with the consent of their commanders, on
behalf of the TLF, was indeed a stain on the group.
Some people, especially TLF sympathizers, accused the TPLF leadership simply
of annihilating an organization which had its own rights. From the outset, one can
logically argue that way without considering the whole context of the matter. It was true
that the TPLF had taken severe measures that amounted to the liquidation of its
counterpart. From a legalistic point of view, the conduct looks unacceptable but there was
no legal framework to which the two organizations could be bound. At such a time, it was
left to one’s conscience to assess under what circumstances the measure was taken and
arrive at a balanced conclusion, in the light of the unjustifiable elimination of seventeen
young Tigraians who had just started to fight for the sake of their people, and without
providing sound justification but only suspicion. On the other hand, if one has to charge
TPLF leaders with measures they committed against fellow fighters later in the struggle,
then one has the obligation to use the same yardstick to pass judgment on the extreme
measures committed by the TLF leaders as well. Finally, it can be said that initially the
TPLF had no reason or interest in destroying the TLF. In fact, as its previous activities
and relations with the TLF indicated, it was committed to forge a broader union and to
46 According to Yohannes Tekle-Haimanot, the Amare group was suspected of abandoning the
ethno-nationalist TLF to joining a multi-national organization like the EPRP, an allegation that
was not corroborated by the facts.
102evolve as a stronger front capable of challenging the government in power. Basically, this
was why the TPLF had to make the long march to the east (unfamiliar territory at the
time) and conduct a series of meetings not only with the TLF but also with other
organizations like the EPRP, as we will discuss in the next chapter. This was why the
TPLF offered the innocent TLF fighters the chance to reinstate their organization, and
made efforts to contact the latter’s urban members in order to cooperate on this track.
Deima – The Eastern Base
The meandering march of the TPLF group from the western to the eastern part of Tigrai
seemed to have ended at Deima, one of the elevated plateaus in the chain of escarpments
facing the Danakil lowlands. Deima is located in the district of Agame, northeast Tigrai.
This place was selected as a base because of its rugged terrain which made it less
accessible for enemy infiltration. It was also strategically situated at the centre of the
future deployment of forces to the south and west of Tigrai. A base area was necessary in
order to function as an organization that waged politico-military war, although the tactic
had to be guerrilla warfare until a substantial force was created to match the government
forces. Without a base area, it was difficult to cope with the almost daily arrival of
newcomers to the Front (varying from 5 to 20 at the time) and to carry on with military
training. There was a need to establish departments that could support the guerrilla
forces. After the controversial measure that decided the fate of the TLF, the mountainous
Aaiga area had served as a base area for about a month but was not suitable in many
aspects: it was too cold to live in and too rugged for the transportation of supplies.
Deima, however, was better situated to the group’s requirements, so it was established
there.
In Deima, a few departments – like the political, economic and medical sections –
were established for the first time to act as back-up for the guerrilla army, which
constituted the major force in the TPLF with well over a hundred combatants at the time.
103Here the movement quickly grew. Squads of 25 to 30 fighters in each were deployed
from Deima in all directions to mobilize the people and attack the enemy whenever the
opportunity arose. Enemy-held towns were penetrated at night to reach clandestine
members and give them assignments or receive reports, to punish or warn enemy
collaborators, especially those who inflicted serious damage on the organization and its
members, and to attack enemy posts that hindered the front’s mobility. In March 1976, a
TPLF squad entered Adigrat, the capital of Agame, where a heavy government artillery
unit was stationed and took printing equipment from the high school situated next to the
unit.
Armed agitprop groups were created to stir up public feeling in the struggle for
self-determination and organize the peasantry at various levels, including forming
clandestine groups that could carry out secret missions. Such secret peasant cells played a
crucial role in infiltrating and destabilizing rival organizations and reaching members in
Dergue-held territories. The political fight against the EDU and the EPRP started in such
a subtle manner until the rival organizations were finally isolated from the people and the
people would join the TPLF side.
While the TPLF’s activities seemed to be moving smoothly from Deima, another
shock suddenly beset the young organization. This time it was the work of a spy sent by
the government military forces based in Deki-Amhare, Eritrea. He was a young boy of
about fourteen. There was no place in the organization at that time for boys of his age,
but he claimed that he had no parents to help him and was forced to work for military
officers who mistreated him. He was therefore allowed to stay in the base area. He was
charming and became popular in a very short period. He started his mission by being
involved and reporting minor mistakes made by ordinary members. From there on, he
began reporting more serious matters, including the fact that certain fighters were
spreading feelings of apathy and some had even gone as far as devising plans to kill other
fighters by putting poison in the food and water they consumed. He strengthened his
allegations by adding that there were peasant collaborators who were supplying the
104poison for this purpose. He gave a list of more than fifteen fighters and two peasants
living nearby and implicated them in the alleged spy network.
Disturbed by this news and not having experience in how to handle such
espionage charges, the leadership hastily ordered the arrest of the named fighters and
peasants, which was followed by interrogation under torture. One innocent fighter, Bahta,
died during this amateurish investigation. Chaos and fear among the rank and file began
to reign and many doubted the informant when they began to realize that the investigation
was leading nowhere. At that point, the leadership understood that it was following the
wrong course and the investigation of members was halted and turned on the boy who
had caused the havoc.
After a long investigation and interrogation, the boy admitted that he was a spy
sent by military intelligence at Deki-Amhare to gradually create mistrust among the
fighters and anarchy in the front. He admitted that he had been sent for that specific
purpose, and was sent to prison where he was finally executed. Although this incident
was solved in a relatively short span of time, it nevertheless created bad feelings and
lingering elements of mistrust among the fellow fighters.
Another undertaking in Deima was the preparation for the fighters’ congress and
celebration of the first anniversary of the TPLF’s formation, due to take place on 18
February 1976 (11 Lekatit 1968 E.C.). Until this time, the organization’s founders had
assumed the leadership role without any special mandate. Now that the organization was
growing in size and poised to embark upon much broader tasks and responsibilities, the
authority to lead had to be mandated in a congress, as tradition in democratic
organizations dictates. From experience in university student politics, the leading
elements of the TPLF knew how elections were organized and they had, at least in
theory, read about Western and Eastern examples. An organization like the TPLF that
claimed to be Marxist needed to develop a flawless character that some such
organizations had demonstrated elsewhere. The leadership formulated a set of criteria to
elect a leader. These were: someone who had struggled for at least two-thirds of the
front’s existence; was above the age of 21; was determined to preserve the culture and
105language of Tigrai; had a strong stand against feudalism, imperialism, fascism and
national oppression; and was courageous, disciplined and loyal to the organization.
Weeks earlier, all the units had begun to converge on Deima. About 120 tegadelti
(revolutionary fighting members) from the front assembled and began discussing the
future programme, constitution and bylaws. Until this time, the organization’s guidelines
had been those inscribed in a two-page TNO document, drafted a year earlier in Addis
Ababa. The document stated, in a nutshell, that the struggle was for the realization of the
self-determination of Tigrai within the bounds of a democratic Ethiopia and that it would
be waged in the form of an armed insurrection that would start in the rural areas of Tigrai.
The general discussions and understanding reached in Deima reflected the basic tenets of
this document. The details of the programme were to be written and published in the
months ahead, as the materials required for publication purposes were not yet available.
The interpretation of self-determination, however, was altered by a group of more
parochial nationalists to mean the ‘secession’ of Tigrai from Ethiopia later in 1976, as
was stipulated in the so-called TPLF manifesto then issued.
The congress also elected a seven-man Marrihentte (leadership) as an executive
body to lead the TPLF for the coming three years. Every fighting member had the right to
vote but, to be elected as a leader one had to pass the criteria set in advance. Accordingly,
six former leaders (Agazi, Mussie, Abbay, Seyoum, Giday and Aregawi) got the highest
votes. Sibhat, a latecomer, also obtained enough votes to secure him a seat in the
leadership. Of the former leaders, Sihul voluntarily withdrew from the running for a
Marrihentte position with the intention of playing a reconciliatory and public relations
role, while Asfaha and Hailu failed to secure enough votes. Only Hailu complained of not
being elected, accusing his former colleagues in the leadership of spreading negative
information about him. Despite individual misgivings, the congress carried on with high
enthusiasm and a sense of commitment to sacrifice whatever the struggle required. For
the first time, a cultural troupe was assembled by Girmay Lemma to mark the founding of
the TPLF. They invoked, among other things, the spirit of the original 1943 Woyyane
revolt while referring to the current uprising as the Second Woyyane, and played folk
106music with a revolutionary content to adorn the occasion of the first anniversary, to boost
the fighting spirit of the tegadelti. This cultural troupe later played a crucial role not only
in raising the spirits of the fighting forces but also in the mobilization of the entire
Tigraian society.
Under the executive body, three main committees (one political, one military and
one socio-economic) plus the chairmanship and the foreign section, each run by a
member of the Marrihentte, were set up. The Marrihentte was collective, with Aregawi
elected as chairman to coordinate the committees, while Mussie, Abbay, Agazi and
Seyoum headed the military, political, socio-economic and foreign committees
respectively. The nature of the guerrilla warfare that had stretched through western,
central and eastern Tigrai forced Marrihentte members to expand their interests and be
involved in all the committees’ activities. Each committee had several departments. The
departments of culture (coded 01); political work (04), security (06), public relations (07)
and administration (08) fell under the political committee. Departments of military
intelligence (00), training (02), ordnance/arms (09) and the whole fighting forces
(regular, militia and special units) were under the military committee. Health (03), the
logistical supply (05), education (001), and agriculture (011) were departments that were
centralized by the socio-economic committee. With military engagement being the
front’s main preoccupation in those early days, departments that had no immediate
contribution to the guerrilla war were left to function with a bare minimum of personnel.
Two platoons, whose collective name were Haili (force) and with no fewer than
45 combat troops in each, were formed. A Haili could have been the equivalent of an
English company, but number-wise the Haili was about the size of a platoon. One was
called Haili Woyyane and was deployed to the east and the south, where the First
Woyyane was started, while the other, called Haili Dedebit, was to cover the central and
western regions. These Hailis had serious tasks to accomplish, ranging from fighting
government forces to challenging rival fronts and local shiftas (bandits) who were still
rampant in Tigrai.
107To sum up, the first year of the TPLF’s struggle was for setting up the
organization, defining the many aspects of the struggle and testing them on the ground.
Establishing the right relationship within the front and with other Ethiopian organizations
and the Eritrean fronts was a complicated task that, at times, resulted in armed
confrontation. When politics falls into the hands of young revolutionaries, the tendency to
resolve the crisis too hastily and violently seems often to be there. This tendency lingered
throughout the struggle, and continued to be the source of conflict and often despair
within and outside the TPLF.
Internally, the crisis that was instigated by the peasant group and was seemingly
aimed at the annihilation of the educated leadership was foiled thanks to the sharp
observations and reaction of Tsegay Tesfay (Kokab) and persistent advice from Sihul.
Although the initial relationship with the TLF was for a constructive journey, it was
destined by the internal circumstances of violence in the TLF itself to end violently.
Although one could not deny the presence of a radical youth mentality in the TPLF which
could led to countervailing violent measures in such circumstance, whether there was an
alternative way of managing the TLF case remains a question even today.
The hardships of guerrilla life especially in the early days of the struggle in the
rugged terrain of Tigrai, the elevation of which ranges from five metres below see level
in the Afar region to over 4000 metres above sea level in the Mount Alajie range and to
even 4620 meters in the operational zone in the Semien mountains across the Tekeze
River, were immense. Often the legs of half of the squad members were burnt as they
slept around a fire to keep warm in the cold climate in Semien. Yet neither such
hardships nor the frequent battles against adversaries had a restraining influence on the
spirit of the TPLF fighters. Their determination to finish the war and defeat the enemy
remained intact throughout. Although the systematically planned and structured approach
of mobilizing the people had not yet begun at this stage, the ideologically motivated
guerrilla activities by themselves as well as the revolutionary objectives proclaimed were
effective mobilizing means, and the people began to give their total support to the front.
The extent of the Tigrai people’s support was encouraging and the guerrilla units did not
108have to worry about food and other basic supplies when they passed through villages.
And some parents even went as far as urging their children to join the front.
Summary
In the first trying year of the guerrilla warfare, the inexperienced elite of the TPLF were
confronted with many difficulties that the struggle evoked. The nature of guerrilla
warfare, threats coming from government forces, confrontations with other armed
opposition fronts, and the urge to demonstrate to the people the viability of the emerging
TPLF were enormous challenges which the nascent organization encountered in its
formative years.
The situation, no doubt, required high-level of commitment and endurance. As
events revealed, the young revolutionaries proved to be committed to the cause they
initiated and managed to remain organized and focused, despite the multiple difficulties
challenging them.
Observers have wondered from where the tenacity of this small insurgent group
came, that enabled them confront the much stronger government forces, and how they
managed to provide effective guidance to revolutionary guerrilla warfare. This can be
understood by linking it to our theoretical departure, i.e., the potency of ethnicity, ethno-
regional / linguistic identity and a measure of class solidarity felt by the insurgent group
and its constituency. In other words, the most likely explanation is perhaps the manner in
which the young revolutionaries blended local, socially and culturally infused ethnicity
with a limited dosage of the Marxist (‘scientific’) class ideology. This seemed to have
generated the organizing ideology which they pragmatically used in devising the tactics
and approaches to deal with the hardships and politico-military challenges they
encountered. They also strongly believed in the Maoist dictum that ‘political power
grows from the barrel of the gun’, hence earnestly applying it to settle differences not
only against the government forces but also rival groups and internal dissenters. The
109revolutionary theory was put in practice by all means and with full dedication.
Furthermore, once in the field and having burnt their bridges, there was no way back for
them without evoking shame and failure in the eyes of their peers and their society. In
this manner the TPLF established itself as a force to be reckoned by its supporters as well
as by its foes. Likewise, the revolutionary elite were asserting themselves as a capable
leadership of the movement.
110Chapter 5
Mobilization and Armed Confrontation
Introduction
Before the armed struggle was launched and as discussed in chapter one, the disgruntled
elite of Tigrai was focused on mobilizing the different social groups in and outside Tigrai
on one core objective: the ‘right to self-determination’. This was basically an ethno-
nationalist call for the attainment of political space within the Ethiopian state structure.
This movement was peaceful but the idea grew that could get the TNO nowhere and that
a higher form of struggle was called for. Chapter 3 treats the continuation of the same
political struggle with a different modus operandi, i.e. revolutionary armed struggle. This
entailed not only the ultimate destruction of government structures and means of control
in the rural areas by isolating the enemy from the population, but also the winning of
hearts and minds of the peasantry by painting a better future for them. This comprised the
introduction of reforms, uprooting bandits and eliminating rival forces that were
considered as obstacles to the realization of the self-determination and social
improvement of Tigrai. With this approach to tackling opposing forces, the organization
would also deal with internal dissenters.
With the prevalence of the TPLF through armed confrontation, it was also creating
the necessary organizational structures to administer and effectively engage the people in
the struggle. Through its administrative structures, the Front was eventually able to direct
the affairs of the people and saw itself capable to respond to the needs of the people in
ways that would embolden the general struggle outlined by the Front, ostensibly to
liberate the people from all sorts of oppression and domination.
111Self-determination as a Means of Mobilization
‘How did the TPLF manage to mobilize the people of Tigrai and seize power in Ethiopia
after defeating one of the strongest armies in Africa?’ was, and still is, a question often
asked by academics, historians and others47. Indeed, it seemed unthinkable that a small
ethno-nationalist organization claiming to represent about 3.5 million people could
ultimately defeat the state army of Ethiopia, which had a population of 55 million with a
well-established, strong army. There seems to be no short and simple answer to this
multi-faceted question. Nevertheless, we can see that the answer lies in the interplay of
many factors, among them the active participation of ordinary people (the ‘masses’), the
will of the fighting force, well-thought-out strategy and tactics, competent leadership
focused on the cause, and, to a certain extent, external support, as is the case in almost
every war waged by an inferior force against a superior government army.
Considering the mobilization process and the fast growth of the TPLF, a combination of
many old and contemporary factors, grounded on ethno-nationalist sentiments, drew the
people of Tigrai to rally behind the TPLF. Some of the long-standing factors were the
evocation of the glorious past coupled with the history of the Tigraian struggle for justice
such as the uprising of the first Woyyane in 1942-43 and the sacrifices the forefathers
made. The increasingly dismal situation and deep dissatisfaction of Tigraians at the time
was the most immediate factor that drew the people to embrace the insurgent movement.
On the other hand, one should always bear in mind that the Dergue, a ruthless military
dictatorship since its inception, created a host of opponents and enemies throughout
Ethiopia because of its authoritarian and coercive policies. First of all, it rejected every
47 Social scientists, including Prof. Christopher Clapham and Dr. Stephen Ellis, have raised this
very question repeatedly with the author. This study, among other things, attempts to provide an
answer via an insider’s analytical observations.
112call for self-determination, genuine or not, by imposing the motto of ‘Ethiopia Tikdem’,48
the interpretation of which was obscure even to the members of the Dergue themselves.
Second, it espoused and imposed Marxism-Leninism in a predominantly traditional
society of Ethiopia where a dictatorship, be it ‘proletarian’ or military, would not have
been tolerated in any measure. In addition, the harsh policies of agricultural
collectivization and the regimentation of society in qebele associations, followed by a
lack of economic success, infuriated vast sectors of the population. Also, unpopular and
mistaken government policies in reaction to legitimate, collective demands of the people,
accompanied by repressive measures the severity of which was new in the history of the
country, pushed the people towards accepting the TPLF as a saviour from the policies of
the Dergue. The heightened use of violence by government forces, as Gurr and Goldstone
(1991: 334) demonstrate, ‘…increased popular sentiment and active support for
revolutionary movements’ also that of the TPLF. Confrontations that tied up government
forces on various fronts throughout the country (e.g., Eritrea, Somalia in 1977-78)
certainly facilitated TPLF mobilization efforts and its subsequent progressive and rapid
growth.49 And last but not least, the TPLF’s organizational structure down to the village
level as well as its tactics of mobilization and the pragmatic style of its leadership and the
determination of the rebel army were crucial factors that continued to attract people to the
Front. Finally, with its tactics, the TPLF began the war by engaging the enemy in isolated
battles where they could be fairly sure of victory. Success in these battles, in turn, were
used to demonstrate the ‘invincibility of the people’s war’ led by the Front. Once the
TPLF had created the conditions for mass mobilization and a ‘people’s war’ to feed on
one another in the struggle for self-determination, its outdoing the rival fronts and
triumphing over its main enemy, the Dergue, became imminent.
48 According to some Dergue members ‘Ethiopia Tikdem’ meant securing the territorial integrity
of the country and to others it meant transforming Ethiopia to a socialist state and still to others it
meant creating a vibrant capitalist nation. This was a reflection of the ideological variants within
the spontaneously formed military ruling group, the Dergue. Understandably, the people in
general had no clear thought of what ‘Ethiopia Tikdem’ meant.
49 In the vast rural areas of Tigrai, there was no meaningful government hold or influence to deter
the mobility of the TPLF. In rural Tigrai, all Dergue activity generated resistance and was nipped
in the bud.
113War by its nature has the tendency of urging people to take sides and participate at
various levels. The war waged by the TPLF, likewise, urged the Tigraians to participate
and pay sacrifices by declaring that the war was waged ‘on behalf of the oppressed
Tigraian masses’. Many people were attracted by the courageous challenge taken up by
‘their sons and daughters’, the change the Front promised, and the hopes they put forward
of achieving victory. As the war intensified, becoming increasingly a war of survival and
necessity with social and economic aspects, more and more people saw no alternative but
to support the TPLF, in the hope of winning as soon as possible and get back to normal
life. This momentum in itself was a mobilizing factor that drew the common people to the
struggle and kept them tied to the Front, the organization of their sons and daughters.
Still, however intrinsic the relationship between the Front and the people might now
appear, elements of coercion, at times disguised and proclaimed as ‘necessary’ for the
success of the struggle, could not be ruled out in such circumstances.
The entire mobilization drive of the TPLF was geared to winning the war against
the Dergue, a for many rural Tigraians unfamiliar force that had emerged in the centre of
the country, far from Tigrai. This intensive mobilization was accompanied by promises of
progress in all aspects of life under a system of ‘true socialist democracy’ after the defeat
of the Dergue. Although the Dergue, like the TPLF, had come up with similar
revolutionary slogans to mobilize the Ethiopian people, it could not impress Tigraians,
whose grievances against governments from the centre had gone too far to mend. Trust in
the central government had been gradually eroded since the early 1940s and in Emperor
Haile Selassie’s last years it had got worse, with famine, poverty, repression and
hopelessness more pronounced than ever. As mentioned above, this situation had already
created responses of covert ethno-nationalist mobilization, growing to full intensity
among the young generation. The Dergue since 1974 started its reign hitting the drums of
war and terror had neither the legitimacy nor the wisdom to reverse this trend and
improve the gloomy conditions or ease tensions. By the mid-1970s, the great majority of
Tigraians were already anticipating locally grown resistance to lead them out of the
quagmire and found the TPLF filling the gap. With a well-articulated ethno-nationalist
114ideology and eclectically crafted class rhetoric, the TPLF answered the clamour of
Tigraians. Had the TPLF failed to fill this gap, likely another local force, for example the
TLF or Teranafit/EDU, would have become the leading organization in Tigrai given the
readiness of the people to take matters into their own hands. However, with the
determination of its fighting forces and excellent mobilization tactics, the TPLF was in a
position to prevail.
Since the hardship and neglect caused by central governments were obvious to the
people, there was no need for the TPLF to convince people of the dismal conditions
existing in Tigrai. Instead by making several practical and daring socio-economic moves
to mitigate the situation, such as opening clinics and schools in remote villages, it
demonstrated that it was there to pose a real challenge and enable the people to stand up
and do something. The decades-long neglect of the region by the central government, the
lawlessness and the rampant banditry (shiftinnet) of the criminal type and other social
miseries could perhaps be stopped and corrected only by a home-grown force. The
argument that the TPLF should have given the Dergue the chance to put its revolutionary
promises into practice and redress hardship and fulfil the aspirations of the people is not
convincing – there were no indications that this was occurring.
In the late 1970s, TPLF guerrilla units, first in a number of platoons and later
growing fast into companies, could easily penetrate any part of rural Tigrai, as far as the
suburbs of the towns held by government forces, to carry out political or military
missions. Attacking isolated military posts, ambushing enemy troops, kidnapping or
killing enemy collaborators and sneaking into enemy-held towns to take in or out
necessary materials for the Front had become routine activities for the units. Most such
operations were accomplished as planned because they were conducted in circumstances
and at the time of choice and with the devotion of highly motivated young fighters. Such
activities boosted the morale of the fighting forces and of the people, whose trust in the
TPLF was growing steadily. Government troops appeared to have no effective defence,
let alone show meaningful counter-offensives, except for rear attacks organized in a huge
campaign form and in most cases ending in failure.
115Uprooting the Shiftas (Bandits)50
In the first and second year of the struggle, if there was resistance of any significance at
all in rural Tigrai, it came from the criminal shiftas (bandits) who under previous regimes
had been able to swarm all over the region. Now, not only the territory the various shiftas
controlled was vital to the growth of the TPLF but also their very existence had to be
terminated to allow the TPLF to develop a social base. Clearing away the scourge of the
shiftas was thus one of the top priorities of the TPLF, its execution proving to be an
effective catalyst of mobilization.
The criminal shiftas in Tigrai were numerous and lived off robbery and subjecting
people to torment. They slaughtered peasants’ animals for a day’s meal, raped women,
robbed and burned down houses whenever their demands were not met. They also killed
anybody who dared to stand in their way, living in the bush outside and above the law.
Some of the shiftas were well established in the remote rural areas, with the sizeable
wealth they had amassed from the peasantry, and they even had a quasi-autonomous
territory that they ruled at will. They levied tax, fines or ransom as they wished. They
used family connections as their intelligence network; and in return, family members
were protected from intrusion by other shiftas. Alemshet Tewolde, who gave himself the
title of dejazmach, which was changed to major when he joined the EDU later on, was
just one well-known example. Along the river gorges in Tekeze and Mereb and deep in
the rural areas, there were hundreds of such shiftas who lived off exploiting and
humiliating peasants and merchants.
In the few months after the start of the armed struggle, the TPLF began to adopt
strict measures on the shiftas by identifying those who were fighting back and at times
inflicting serious damage on TPLF units. By dealing with the important shiftas, the
50 The broad meaning of banditry (Tigrigna: shiftiest), ranging from social protest to criminal
practices, should be considered in reading this section. Here we are dealing with the shifta of the
criminal type.
116numerous small ones became demoralized and gave up without resistance. Many
notorious shiftas were apprehended and paraded before the community they had
disgraced. At public gatherings, their misdemeanours were exposed and they were
punished for the crimes they committed. Some who had committed only minor crimes
were set free after pleading guilty and those who were convinced of the causes of the
national struggle were allowed to join the Front. Many of the shiftas who resisted arrest
were killed in shootouts. A number joined other fronts like the EDU, where they were
welcomed without question. Later, in the confrontation with the EDU, they were the ones
who fought fiercely to avenge their grudges against the TPLF.
The TPLF army was highly disciplined. Its behaviour exceeded the expectations of
the people because it used to be common practice in Tigrai for an armed individual to
exhibit coercion whenever s/he wanted something. If there was any one thing that earned
praise for the TPLF, it was the way it maintained discipline in its army all the way
through the struggle. Initially, all the leading elements of the TPLF were familiar with the
manual entitled ‘Who is a Revolutionary’ – a text that contained a list of ‘do’s’ and
‘don’ts’ for those engaged in a revolutionary and/or liberation movement. They strictly
maintained the discipline of the army according to this manual. There was also a set of
internal rules that told fighters what they could and could not do, accompanied by
disciplinary measures to be taken if someone was found to be breaking the rules. For
instance, rape was punishable by death. The rigorous political education which was given
to the army almost every day was partly political and partly a rehearsal of ‘Who is a
Revolutionary’. There were political cadres in every unit, small or big, who ensured
adherence to the code of conduct and who took care of the weekly (sometimes even
daily) ‘criticism and self-criticism sessions’ (gimgema) where ‘undesirable behaviour’
was scrutinized. A fighter’s every single movement was under surveillance and he could
not leave his unit even for water without the commander’s permission and if s/he had
secured permission to leave, there would be someone accompanying him/her. When the
fighters showed such (unprecedented) discipline, the people began to relax and
participate more freely in the activities initiated by the Front. Women could mix with the
117TPLF army without the fear of being raped. Children would sit around TPLF fighters to
discuss relevant issues on an equal basis. They also played, learned and listened or told
stories related to the struggles of the past and present. The peasants began to enjoy their
rights over their property. Nobody could touch their property. When a TPLF platoon or
company arrived in a village and needed food, it would present its request through the
village public relations officer called kuadere who would collect whatever kind of food
the villagers had to offer. Those who could not afford to provide their share were
exempted, thereby observing the principle of equality in the TPLF’s administration.
However, if a well-to-do peasant refused to provide the expected supply, the kuadere
would bring the case before the community for scrutiny and punishment, which could be
carried out by the TPLF. Such administrative enforcement was applied with every other
service the Front required, and refusal was unacceptable.
When in late 1976-77 the TPLF had prevailed and shiftas had no more place to
hide and the consequences for them were too obvious if they dared to show up, people
began to feel free to move from place to place to trade, to farm or visit relatives without
the fear of harassment and robbery. The barriers of freedom of mobility seemed to have
been removed, and also the flow of young recruits from the community increased with
every passing day. To the peasants, it was a time of relief, demonstrated by their new-
found mobility and their prompt response to calls from the Front. Organized to handle
matters in their respective villages, the peasants began to feel powerful with or without
the presence of the TPLF in the vicinity. Locally elected peasant leaders ran the defence
and administrative functions of their respective localities. Trust and confidence were thus
growing both ways. Thus the TPLF in less than a year since the launch of its mobilization
of the people was taking lasting shape. Peasants were organized at different levels to
support themselves and the Front. They had to defend and administer the territory and
elect capable men and women from their ranks to lead them. Militia forces were created
not only to keep peace and order in their territory but also to back the regular guerrilla
forces in major engagements with the enemy, sometimes far from their villages. Peasants,
women and the youth formed separate associations and became involved in the different
118activities outlined by the Front or their association. Participating in the literacy campaign
and political education, supplying the fighting forces with food and water, carrying the
wounded to safe places for treatment, burying the dead and passing information on shiftas
who were still on the loose, were some of the routine activities of the village people and
executed by their respective associations. Other activities were undertaken directly by the
organization, which had several departments for the purpose (see Figure 3.1).
Organizational Development and Structure
The diagram in Figure 3.1 was adopted by the TPLF Fighters’ Congress held in 1976 and
it developed into the diagram in Figure 3.2 in subsequent years leading up to the First
Organizational Congress, convened in 1979. Mass (civic) associations were represented
at the latter congress.

The organizational structure of the TPLF started to take shape during the Fighters’
Congress held in Diema, in the district of Agame. The Fighters’ Congress elected a
seven-man executive body commonly called the merihnet (leadership). Once the
executive body was formed, the task of creating and developing the remaining structure
with the need and size of the Front fell to it. As the leaders were Marxist revolutionary by
persuasion, it was obvious both the initial and the latter structures resembled that of a
Marxist-Leninist vanguard party. The rest of the fighters had to accept what the few top
leaders decided. All departments in the Front fell under three large committees: political,
military and socio-economic, with each composed of members of the central committee
(CC) led by a member of the politburo. Only the foreign affairs department, which fell
under the political committee, was also led by a politburo member. Each committee got
120its directives from the CC through the politburo that was coordinated by the
organization’s chairman and vice chairman. The three committees executed CC directives
through the various departments assigned to them. In this section we will look at the
departments that were directly involved in the mobilization and organization of the
people although in practical terms every TPLF section and individual member was
somehow involved in self-imposed mobilization tasks.
Department of Propaganda (Kifli Politica)
Unlike the other departments, the propaganda department was the seat of the political
committee headed by Abbay Tsehaye, and the political directives of the CC and politburo
were put into effect under his direct supervision. Meles Zenawi was assigned as deputy
head of the department, on the recommendation of Abbay Tsehaye.
The department was responsible for preparing political education manuals and
propaganda materials at different levels. For newly recruited fighters, a comprehensive
political education manual, providing the essence of revolutionary struggle in general and
the right to self-determination of Tigrai in particular, was prepared, to be given as part of
the standard training. Other publications were also appearing sequentially. Some of them
were: Woyeen (Revolt), a monthly official organ of the Front, Nikah (Be Conscious), and
a theoretical magazine appearing occasionally, Ittek (Get Armed), an occasional paper
mainly for the peasants, and Tegadel (Struggle), an internal paper dealing with the
organization’s positive and negative developments. Seminar papers for various sections
of society, like women, youth, and priests, were also prepared in this department.
Over the course of time, a cadre school was established within this department
which also prepared educational materials. Any fighter committed to and well versed in
the ideological and political lines of the Front was referred to as a cadre. The cadre
education was given at two levels: one for peasants, and the other for the educated
members of the Front, which was more of advanced ideological and political discourse.
Establishing the cadre school enabled the TPLF to produce many qualified cadres who
could not only mobilize people to support the struggle but who would also challenge rival
121organizations like the EPRP and EDU politically and ideologically. Eventually however,
and to the dismay of many democratic fighters, the cadre school became the ground
where cadres for the ultra-left Marxist Leninist League of Tigrai (MLLT) were hatched.
Department of Culture (Kifli Bahli)
A major agent of mobilization in the TPLF struggle for self-determination was the
cultural department. It had been established in 1976 just a few weeks before the first
anniversary of the TPLF and was to play a crucial role in the mobilization the mass of
Tigraians in the years to come. It was established with Girmay Lemma – then better
known as Girmay Bahli – as its head, a young dedicated fighter who before he joined the
TPLF had been a member of the Bahli Tigrai, a cultural band during the last years of
Haile Selassie’s era. The general directives for the Kifli Bahli came from the political
committee of the Front, which also had departments of mass organization (kifli hizbi),
security (halewa Woyyane) and public relations (rikib) in its administrative structure.
The task given to this department was to undertake the mobilization process
through cultural activities that would create social awareness to act collectively in the
liberation movement. In other words, the mobilization mandate was aimed at enabling the
people of Tigrai to participate in various types of political and military activities
involving the promotion of self-determination and the defence of concomitant ideas,
values and history that would have to prevail in the future, following the defeat of the
repressive Dergue government. Girmay was responsible for organizing a cultural troupe
and implementing the mobilization directives. After completing the political and military
training of the Front, experienced musicians and actors were assigned to the kifli bahli to
promote the fighting spirit of the entire Tigraian community. It composed poems that
reflected the existing condition of the people vis-à-vis its past glories, music that was
based on the popular songs of resistance and heroism and short plays that depicted the
essence of the struggle. The titles of some of the early songs were: Zeytishifen hakegn
Kiya (Inextinguishable True History), Kiltsim hafash (Forearm of the Masses), Meny’u
bedelegna (Who is the Culprit), Aawot n’witsue (Victory to the Oppressed), Ka’a jemere!
122(Here They Rise Up!), Walta hizbi (Shield of the People), Zeyhilel kalsi (Irresistible
Struggle). The verses of the popular ‘Irresistible Struggle’, for instance, ran as follows:
Our sea is the mass of the people,
Our logistics is the revolutionary courage,
Our trenches are the mountains around us,
Our trust is in the correct principles we uphold.
It was the duty of the cultural troupes to visit the villages, playing revolutionary and
nationalist songs and perform short plays to educate, entertain and mobilize the people.
All cultural activities were performed at night because of the fear of air raids. When a
cultural troupe arrived in a village, everybody expected an eventful night. The area
designated for assembly and the cultural show would be packed with people long before
the show began. When it was time for the show, the cultural troupe would be introduced
to the people by a mass organization cadre (kifli hizbi) assigned to that area, who in
almost every case would narrate the current achievements of the Front and the debacle of
the enemy to date. The cadre would then appeal to the people to intensify their
participation in the struggle and conclude with the ceaselessly reiterated slogan, ‘Our
struggle is long and bitter; our victory is definite!’ and the crowd had to repeat it raising
its fists high in the air. This slogan, which was popularized in various ways, served as
therapy whenever government troops had inflicted damage from the air or on the ground.
Most of the time, such occasions served as a recruiting ground for new fighters.
One or two songs were dedicated to each section of the society. Children, youth,
women, peasants, workers and the militia all had at least one song dedicated to them. The
songs often evoked the struggle and sufferings of the working people and recited the
responsibilities and expectations of each group. The group got up to dance when its
respective song was played and everybody seemed moved by the messages in the lyrics.
The lyrics of almost every song ended with messages arousing all the social groups to
participate in the war of liberation. Emulating the works of the Kifli Bahli, many cultural
123groups were created in the woreda (district) and the small villages. In some woredas, the
youth, women, children and older people had formed their own respective cultural
troupes and performed at intervals. As events unfolded, the work of the Kifli Bahli
definitely pulled in millions of people to hear the politics of the day and by so doing
proved to be an effective mobilization tool. The department’s impact was such that many
people were aroused to fight the enemy and also to talk emphatically about it to others.
Department of Mass (civic) Organization (Kifli Hizbi)
It was the Kifli Hizbi on the ground that connected the people with the Front in almost all
aspects of the struggle, and through it, the Front was able to make its presence felt.
Better-educated cadres of the Front were assigned to this department, which dealt directly
with the people on matters concerning their administration, organization and fighting
spirit or morale. Every liberated district under control of the TPLF had one kifli hizbi
cadre as an executive administrator, educator and, at times, leader of its fighting militia,
who was often engaged with enemy units that attempted to infiltrate their villages and
knowing about the absence of the hailitat (regular fighting forces) in the area.
During the day, the cadres gave political education at public meetings, heard cases
that had not been resolved by the local authorities and organized the people to carry out
tasks that were required either by the community or the Front. At night, they worked with
village cells to learn about enemy activities inside or outside the community and
exchange views on how to deal with the situation. They had to foil enemy propaganda or
infiltration and, in later years, the activities of rival organizations like the EDU or the
EPRP, believed to be obstructing the Tigraian struggle for self-determination and thus
falling into the enemy category. If a person was thought to be standing against the TPLF,
the kifli hizbi cadre would report them to the Security of the Revolution Department
(Halewa Woyyane) for further investigation. This department would carry out an
investigation, usually by putting the suspect in prison. After the investigation was
completed, the halewa Woyyane would include its recommendation and submit the case
to an area CC member for a verdict. Any CC member had the power to review an
124investigation and pass a verdict. In this short and simple process, the fate of an individual
believed to be an enemy or to be against the Front in one form or another could be
decided. The idea of defence lawyers or appeals was considered an unnecessary
bureaucratic and a counter-revolutionary practice. Many fighters and civilians fell victim
to this simplistic and harsh system of handling cases of wrongdoers.
The War with the EDU51
When the Dergue had seized power in 1974, it began arresting former high-ranking
government officials and members of the monarchy. Though it was gloating over its
sweeping away all the senior members of the old system, there was one exception. It did
not dare to arrest the last hereditary Governor of Tigrai, Ras Mengesha Seyoum, mainly
for fear of a rebellion by the Tigraians against such an act, which would have been
reminiscent of the 1942-43 uprising in Tigrai. During these uncertain days, the Ras
slipped away to the ELF-controlled area in Eritrea. With the help of the ELF, he made his
way to Sudan where he joined other members of the old regime, like General Nega
Tegegn who earlier managed to escape arrest by the Dergue marshals. In Sudan,
members of the old regime and well-known feudal lords prepared the formation of a
nationwide organization and later created the Ethiopian Democratic Union (EDU) in
London in 1976. Their aim was to overthrow the Dergue and reinstate the former pro-
western system of governance, but perhaps in a reformed set-up (democratic, as they
claimed). The governments of Sudan, Saudi Arabia and many western countries
including the US were on their side. This alliance fitted into the Cold War alignment, for
the Dergue appeared to embrace a Soviet-Union style socialist path.
Before the EDU declared its existence, supporters of Ras Mengesha Seyoum all
over Tigrai were regrouping and awaiting their leader’s call. In Shire in western Tigrai,
several of such groups were emerging. Initially, in 1975, an independent group known as
51 For further details see TPLF, ‘Fitsametat-Woyyanena’ (in Tigrigna, 1978 E.C.), pp. 104-110.
125the Tigrai People’s Liberation Movement Teranafit Committee (here after referred to by
its acronym Teranafit) was formed in Gulgula in western Shire. The founders of this
movement included Tigraian nationalists like Lieutenant Berhane Girmay and haleke
Tesfay Gebre-Hiwet. According to Lt. Berhane, Tamene Gebru (Lingo), Teklai Mehari
(who later defected to the TPLF), Tesfay Asgedom, Giday Bahrishum, Berhane Desta,
Hagos Desta and captain Kahsay Abraha (who also defected to the TPLF), contributed to
the formation of this organization.52 The word Teranafit means an authoritative co-
coordinator and, as the name suggests, this group was assuming for itself the
responsibility of organizing the scattered anti-Dergue groups of ethno-nationalists and
possibly those waiting for Ras Mengesha too. Lt. Berhane elaborates:53
‘The aim of the Teranafit Committee was to fight national oppression and
bring social justice and equality for all nationalities and citizens. But the
struggle was not unified. We saw the need of bringing together all the anti-
Dergue elements, which were fighting in groups separately under one
centralized command. This was the reason why they added the name
Teranafit Committee to the organization. We were engaged in an
unnecessary war with the TPLF. After the EDU was formed in London and
began its activities in Sudan, we were contacted to work together, to which
we concurred. Subsequently, we were supplied with a few arms and jointly
we attacked the Dergue forces in Humera and Metema. Although there was
no formal merger, the Teranafit Committee eventual became part of the EDU
in the struggle against the Dergue’.
Although this movement had mobilized a few hundred combatants, mainly of a peasant
background but also a good number of feudal lords, it was a loose organization awaiting
52 Giday Bahrishum (1985 E.C.: 130) in his memoir ‘Amora’ (in Tigrigna) puts Berhane Girmay,
Tesfay Gebrehiwet, himself, and Tesfay Asgedom in order of their importance as founders of Teranafit.
53 Interview: Lt. Berhane Girmay, Atlanta, GA, 28 July 2003.
126political or military guidance from Ras Mengesha’s EDU, whose return was thought to be
the key solution to all of their problems. Until a structural link was established, however,
the Teranafit acted on its own whims, without a clearly defined organizational structure
and political programme. It vehemently rejected the idea of socialism or ‘land to the
tiller’ – ideas emanating from the revolutionary sector, the Dergue and the TPLF. At the
same time, preserving tradition was their main concern and the central theme of their
political agitation. This situation left many of its members in confusion, and some with an
educational background defected to join the TPLF, as confirmed above by Lt. Berhane.
The Teranafit Committee did not like the TPLF’s growing popularity, and even less the
defection of members from its ranks to the TPLF. As a result of its internal flaws, the
apprehension of this organization became a source of confrontation with the TPLF.
At the beginning, the TPLF was looking for a political solution to the
confrontation with the Teranafit Committee. The TPLF held the view that the Teranafit
Committee was a collection of ‘feudal elements and bandits’ who rallied poor peasants
with false and opportunistic promises. So by working together against the Dergue or
simply co-existing with the Teranafit Committee, the TPLF believed that over the course
of time, it could attract the peasant army whose class as well as national aspirations was
best addressed in its own programme. For the Teranafit Committee, on the other hand,
the TPLF was just a collection of radical elements and anarchists who were part of the
tide that had wrecked an orderly system for which their future leader Ras Mengesha was
an icon. So, knowing the return of Ras Mengesha would lead them to the final state of
defining their relationship with the TPLF, they also tended to prefer reconciliation based
on peaceful co-existence. Despite the duplicity on both sides for reconciliation to buy
time, neither side was in any position to tolerate the other, even on trivial matters.
Meanwhile, elders (shimageles) of the Shire district, in the traditional manner,
were involved in creating the conditions necessary for the two groups to reach a
negotiated settlement towards working together against the common enemy, the Dergue.
In fact at one point, after long difficult negotiations that took several days, a general
agreement was reached and it was accompanied by an elaborate festive ceremony. The
127agreement, however, did not last long, mainly because neither side was genuinely
committed to reconciliation and because the ‘devil was in the details’ which were not
worked out. Loose as it was, the Teranafit could not control its army, which was
fragmented under sectarian chiefs often engaged in looting and other banditry activities.
On 13 June 1976, a detachment of the Teranafit group seized control of a civilian bus in
the town of Enda Selassie that belonged to a private businessman, Haji Abdu. On the way
to a different mission, a small TPLF unit led by Gessesew Ayele (Sihul) stopped the
detachment of the Teranafit Committee with the bus they appropriated at Adi Nebriid and
demanded its return to its rightful owner. The response was an unexpected fury of bullets,
which killed Sihul and Senay on the spot and wounded a third fighter. The sudden death
of Sihul shocked the entire TPLF membership and many people who knew about him in-
and outside Shire. The TPLF regarded this incident as a declaration of war, which indeed
defined the remaining relationship between the Teranafit Committee and the TPLF. To
make matters worse, the forces of the Teranafit began flexing their muscles with an
aggressive attitude towards the TPLF or anybody who did not support them. This attitude
was aggravated by the news that fresh EDU forces were appearing in the Wolkait region,
as fellow armed groups from the Humera farm area and also from across Eastern Sudan
were joining them.
Following Sihul’s death, the TPLF leadership unanimously decided to take abrupt
retaliatory action with the aim of sweeping away the Teranafit Committee forces from
Western Tigrai. Sihul’s death was the immediate cause of the political vendetta to
eliminate the Teranafit Committee, but it was not the fundamental cause, as some critics
of the TPLF would like to believe. From here on, the Teranafit became a target of TPLF
attack. The EDU, however, was not easy to discount, as its forces gradually would take
over from the Teranafit and became armed with modern arms supplied by Sudan. For the
TPLF, the EDU was constituted of ‘feudal class remnants’ of the old regime who
mobilized the numerous bandits and jobless peasants with a go-ahead to loot from the
people. Worst of all, in the eyes of the TPLF, was EDU’s apparent aim to reinstate the
old monarchic order.
128The plan to deal with the relatively stronger EDU was already in preparation and
required a force with superior war tactics. This necessitated changes in the deployment of
TPLF forces, which were at the time in haili (company) formation. Two companies (haili
11 and 12) were on their way to the southern front for a series of operations, beginning
with an attack on the Dergue force at Abiy Adi-Tembien. On 12 June 1976, they
annihilated a counter-insurgency force of the Dergue called Nebelbal (Flame) at Serro,
between Adwa and Adigrat. Now, they had to cancel their mission to the south and head
west to where the EDU/Teranafit army was based and inflicting severe damage on
prominent TPLF fighter units. Led by Mussie, the experienced military commander, and
with company commanders, Haile Portsudan and Awalom for haili 11th and Ahferom and
Shewit for haili 21st, they came close to Adi Nebriid and began planning where and when
to attack the Teranafit. Haili 41st, led by Seye and Walta, was in the lowlands of the west
in a defensive position as threats of assault from the Teranafit were looming over it, but
relaying vital information about the rapidly changing Teranafit’s strength and mobility to
the advancing forces under Mussie.
In mid-July 1976, a strong EDU/Teranafit force of well over 500 troops marched
to Adi Nebriid, not knowing that an infuriated TPLF force under Mussie had arrived in a
nearby village the night before. In the morning, Teranafit forces were completely
encircled and after a fierce battle that lasted no less than four hours, its forces were
defeated. One hundred and twenty-five of them were taken as POWs and the rest were
either dead or wounded. With high morale and better equipped now with captured semi-
automatic guns, TPLF forces advanced towards the western lowlands of Adiabo to mop
up. With Sheraro, a small town in the lowlands where the TPLF always enjoyed popular
support, as a centre, both the mop-up operations and wider mobilization began. In the
following three months, intensive mobilization was carried out throughout western
Tigrai, highlighting to the local population the ‘revolutionary mass-based’ programme of
the TPLF vis-à-vis the ‘reactionary nature’ of Teranafit’s pursuit and the character of its
undisciplined army. Such mobilization was also deemed necessary to deny any ground to
129the anticipated comeback of such a force, whose leaders were now congregating in
neighbouring Sudan.
Many EDU/Teranafit fighters who survived the Adi Nebriid offensive fled to
Sudan to consult their leader Ras Mengesha. This time the Ras had acquired the support
of both the Sudanese government and the ELF, and thus was in a position to reorganize,
arm and finance his cohorts. The defeated Teranafit troops were retrained and became
part of the new organization, the Ethiopian Democratic Union (EDU), formed by
generals, governors and diplomats of Haile Selassie’s defunct regime. Although they
were regimented under the EDU, the Teranafit force remained as an autonomous
contingent, poised to grab Tigrai while still paying allegiance to Ras Mengesha. It also
mobilized thousands of demobilized farm labourers from the districts of Wolkait and
Armacheho, particularly from the Humera agricultural belt, and supplied them with
modern arms, like Russian-made Simonov and RPGs (rocket launchers). With renewed
morale and a revengeful intent to punish the TPLF, a large EDU contingent was
dispatched to western Tigrai in the middle of September 1976. A detachment of about
250 (led by Giday Bahrishum, Mebrahitu Aradom, Alemshet Tewolde, Gebremeskel
Kahsay and Blata Admasu) arrived in a village called Chiameskebet (not far from
Sheraro) on 26 September 1976. It was the eve of Meskel (the ‘Finding of the True
Cross’), a Christian holiday celebrated by burning a large pile of long woods that releases
dense smoke and whose direction was held to signify the community’s future. On Meskel
day, a pitched battle erupted in the village between a TPLF company led by Haile
Portsudan and Awalom and the main EDU force. The TPLF Company was soon
reinforced by a larger force under Mussie, which was lulled by the presence of an ELF
unit to a nearby strategic place called Mentebteb through which EDU forces were
expected to come. For hours, both sides fought hard and the air filled with thick smoke.
The battle was so fierce that local people related it to the ‘anger of God’ who, as tradition
on the battle has it, ordered the burning of people instead of wood on this Meskel day.
What should have been a scene of celebration turned out to be a scene of carnage. Both
sides suffered heavy losses that they had not seen before. The TPLF lost many of its
130militant commanders like Ahferom, Abraha Manjus, and Bahabelom. Mussie, the TPLF’s
general commander, was seriously wounded and died soon afterwards. On the EDU side,
two of their commanders, Gebremeskel Kahsay and Blata Admasu were captured, while
the others escaped into the wilderness. Although the EDU detachment lost the battle of
Chiameskebet, the war was clearly just beginning, as EDU leaders in Khartoum were
earnestly mobilizing people for a major comeback. The defeated detachment of the EDU,
however, retired to remote villages and across the River Tekeze expecting strong
reinforcements from Sudan that would pave their way back to the battlefield in Tigrai.
This was to happen in five months’ time.
Beginning the day the EDU was defeated and forced out of Tigrai, a situation was
created for the TPLF to actively mobilize people by establishing mass organizations,
armed militias and administrative units in every village, and to try hard to satisfy the
expectations of the people, as promised in its programme. They thought the nature and
intentions of the EDU were aggressively exposed and it was believed that the EDU would
not set foot any more in Tigrai.
TPLF units were thus engaged in a wide range of activities in the central area.
They had to thwart the anti-TPLF campaigns of both the EPRP in eastern and central
Tigrai and of the ELF along the borders with Eritrea. They were also engaged in
frustrating the Dergue’s mobility by disrupting its communication system, conducting
spectacular ambushes, and foiling military campaigns like the Raza Zemecha (see
Chapter Four). They also took hostage some foreigners who had come to work in
government-held areas and through such media-sensitive measures made it known to the
world that the TPLF was in control of the greater part of Tigrai. To the dismay of the
British government and its journalists, in May 1976 a British veterinarian Dr. Lindsey
Tyler and his family, and later in June, John Swain, a British journalist working for The
Sunday Times, were taken hostage in Tembien and Serro in central Tigrai respectively.
Swain had come to cover the Dergue’s Raza Campaign, launched in May 1976. All the
hostages were taken to the EPLF base area in Sahil for that was more secure than that of
the TPLF at the time. The EPLF was willing to have them not only to comply with a
131TPLF request but also because of the diplomatic advantage in dealing with the British.
After months of captivity when the propaganda objectives were met, all the Britons were
released through Sudan with the mediation of the Sudanese government. Although the
Sudanese government at this time favoured the EDU and gave it diplomatic and material
support, it could not ignore the fast-growing TPLF that was operating across its eastern
border.
After its first debacle in Tigrai at the hands of TPLF forces, it took some five
months for the EDU to reorganize, train and arms its troops, who were recruited not only
from Tigrai but also from Gondar, Gojjam, Wollo and other regions of Ethiopia. Due to
the political alignments during the Cold War, they had acquired the support of Sudan,
Britain, the US (see Markakis 1990: 243) and some other Western governments, like
Germany. They declared they would remove the Dergue in a couple of weeks and smash
the TPLF on their way. They were able to provide the thousands of Ethiopian refugees in
Sudan and the farm labourers in Western Ethiopia with modern light arms, including
rocket-propelled guns. Their declaration and provision of modern arms attracted many
peasants, especially those outside TPLF-held territories. When they set forth on their
march from eastern Sudan to Ethiopia, they numbered well over ten thousand but as they
passed through village after village more and more peasants joined them. To attract more
people to their ranks, EDU commanders confidently bragged about their ability to crush
any force on earth and that their troops would own the arms handed to them, including
whatever they looted.
In early March 1977, EDU forces began their major offensive by attacking
government forces at Humera and Metema, towns bordering Sudan. The fall of these
towns was a humiliating setback to the Ethiopian government. Apart from the military
defeat, the Dergue lost substantial income from farm revenue. Also a huge agricultural
labour force that could potentially be easily mobilized as a fighting force was now falling
into the hands of the EDU. By demolishing the military garrisons at Metema and
Humera, the EDU opened up a strategic corridor that linked it with Sudan. The morale
and material gains achieved as a result of this victory meant that the EDU had the upper
132hand, and this tilted the balance of power in northwest Ethiopia in its favour. At the end
of March, with over ten thousand militia, the EDU crossed the River Tekeze and overran
the entire district of Adiabo, where the TPLF had cultivated popular support during the
previous two years.
Although the well-armed and numerically superior EDU was advancing
aggressively, the TPLF, which had only about a thousand fighters at the time, opted to
confront the EDU. The reasons for confronting the much stronger EDU at the time were
many and are thought to be valid to this day. For the TPLF, and indeed for all the
revolutionary forces in Ethiopia, the emergence of the EDU from the crumbling
monarchic system was to ‘reverse the wheel of history’ and resurrect the old political
order. The revolutionaries considered the EDU venture to be futile. Secondly, the TPLF
passionately believed the people should be protected from all sorts of pillage by the
undisciplined and loosely commanded ravaging army of the EDU, thereby proving to the
people that popular, ‘anti-feudal’ principles mattered a great deal. Thirdly, the need to
defend its main base area, Bumbet, and other establishments in this region that were
sources of income to the Front, was also a serious matter that could not be compromised.
In mid-March 1977, EDU forces made a swift move to Sheraro, where just one
TPLF company confronted them. A fierce battle raged near Sheraro and in a matter of
two to three hours, the TPLF Company was overwhelmed by swarms of EDU units
whose sheer number was alarming. Most of them were armed with modern machine
guns, automatic rifles and rocket-propelled guns, far excelling the meagre rifles of the
TPLF. With manageable casualties, the company retreated to its base area in Bumbet,
north of Bademe, where the ELF, now a close ally of the EDU, was creating havoc for
TPLF units and Tigraians living there. This swift re-emergence of the EDU in such huge
numbers and well-armed shocked the TPLF. In the meantime though, the TPLF was
pulling its forces from the eastern and central regions to the west for a major encounter.
At Adi Nebriid, east of Sheraro, seven out of nine TPLF companies had dug
trenches for a defensive battle. The terrain had been selected for its strategic advantage
over an enemy coming from the northwest. Taking advantage of the terrain and to avoid
133encirclement by the numerically superior force, all seven companies were stretched on a
long line of defence without any reserve. Giday Zeratsion and Aregawi Berhe, both CC
members of the TPLF, commanded them. The ‘motivated’ forces of the EDU who
thought the TPLF was no longer in a position to pose a meaningful threat, continued their
march to Enda Selassie, the capital of the district of Shire, where the Dergue’s brigade
was stationed. They were over-confident about overrunning any TPLF force. On their
way to Shire, they had to pass through Adi Nebriid, where TPLF companies were
positioned to stop them and, if the circumstances allowed it, to push them back to where
they had come from. But would it work out the way the TPLF planned it? EDU forces
flocked in three directions towards Adi Nebriid at midday on 12 March 1977. The battle
raged in all three directions, both sides fighting with passion. In many instances, the EDU
force attempted to break the TPLF defence lines at various spots but they were repulsed
leaving behind their dead and wounded every time they attempted to make a charge.
After a whole day of fighting, darkness fell and the barrage of gunfire came to a halt, at
least for a while. Unable to make any headway, the EDU force camped in nearby villages
not far from the TPLF defence lines, only to resume the fight at dawn. At night, TPLF
forces, whose human losses were minimal, regrouped and made arrangements because
they were short of ammunition and guns. The next morning, EDU forces, reinforced with
fresh battalions, resumed their offensive moving back and forth close to the TPLF
trenches which at the time made calculated charges on their assailants. The battle again
raged the whole day with no one claiming victory or conceding defeat but with casualties
rising on both sides. Towards the end of the day, TPLF units completely ran out of
ammunition and most of their guns were useless, several of them had their barrels twisted
from the excessive firing of bullets. They reached a stage where they could not continue
fighting a static battle with an enemy whose human and material resources appeared not
to be dwindling. After removing their casualties to safer areas at the end of the second
day, TPLF forces retreated in an orderly fashion to nearby terrain where they would not
be attacked without the enemy also paying a high price. The TPLF force was reduced by
a third and three-quarters of their guns were gone. In the evening, EDU forces entered
134Adi Nebriid with hundreds of casualties. They found a deserted town, which was much
easier to loot. For the moment the battle between the EDU and the TPLF seemed to have
come to an end, but not in a conventional way. However, for the EDU, which could wage
war in no other way than the conventional, a deadly confrontation continued with the
government army in Enda Selassie in Shire days later.
In the two-day battle at Adi Nebriid, TPLF forces were forced to retreat after
inflicting substantial loses on the EDU army that made it think twice about confronting
the TPLF again. From then on, the EDU could not proceed through TPLF-held territory
without paying a heavy cost to mobilize the feudal and shifta elements in the central
region and beyond. The significance of this battle was that it deterred the EDU from
growing fast and progressively by mobilizing all feudal elements and shiftas in the region
thus becoming a formidable force in Ethiopia that could bring back the defunct old
system and reverse the tide of history.
A few months later, after reviewing its tactics and strategy on how to deal with the
EDU, the TPLF came back to strike but this time adopting the tactics of guerrilla warfare,
which required high discipline and perseverance. EDU forces, particularly its privileged
and absentee leadership, (residing overseas) were not prepared for such a painstaking
venture. They were continuously ambushed and attacked by surprise in Shire district,
where they remained contained until their final defeat. In a war that took almost three
years (April 1977 - November 1979), the TPLF managed to weaken and at last drive
EDU forces out of the whole of Tigrai. The battle of Quinat-Arbaete (the Four-Day
Battle) in November 1979 over a long stretch of land and during which time EDU forces
were chased out of Adiabo, was the final and decisive one.
After this blow, the EDU never returned as a fighting force. On the diplomatic and
political front too, the EDU did not match the rigorous strides of the TPLF. The Nimeiri
government in Sudan allowed the TPLF through its humanitarian wing, the Relief
Society of Tigrai (REST), to open offices in Khartoum, Port Sudan and several border
towns. The ‘land to the tiller’ issue, the behaviour of its undisciplined army and the lack
of leadership to give strategic guidance on the ground contributed to the EDU`s isolation
135and, finally, its defeat. In Sudan, where the EDU’s top leaders were based, the political
and diplomatic offensive was intense, with the TPLF gradually gaining the upper hand.
The TPLF was able to mobilize significant numbers of refugees there and at the same
time began to enjoy success on the battle field not only against the EDU but also against
the Dergue, and thus outstripped them in the political and diplomatic battles. The
endurance exhibited by TPLF fighters followed by success on the battlefield was
expounded by the Front as an illustration of the ‘correct and popular principles’ it was
upholding. This played a big part in the TPLF’s further mobilization process among the
population not only in Tigrai but also further afield.
In these years, parallel to the formation of regular fighting forces, a militia army,
as a rearguard, was established throughout rural Tigrai. Only 5-10 % of the militia were
women, as most of them were occupied at home with family matters and there were
cultural and religious restrictions too. Young girls and single women however were
joining the Front in such large numbers that the Front had to introduce and enforce a
quota system to limit the flow. Women were attracted to the Front because they said they
wanted to run away from the repressive culture at home and also to fight alongside their
male compatriots, both for the self-determination of Tigrai and their own liberation.
The formation of the militia (Woyenti) was organized at woreda (sub-district level)
but when necessary, especially during engagements with the enemy, there were
contingency formations of the Woyenti at district or regional level. Another army
structure that operated between the regular and the militia forces was the formation of
frontline troops called Kirbit, which were mainly engaged in guerrilla activities. The
Kirbits were small units comprising 10-15 combatants that monitored enemy mobility at
district level and, together with the area’s militia, defended the ‘liberated’ territory. When
serious engagements took place with the enemy, a task force of the regular Woyenti and
Kirbits was formed to defend territory or attack the enemy when the opportunity arose.
The militia, which was essentially a civilian force engaged in farming, was the best link
between the Front and the local people in every district. When there was the need to
involve the general public in fighting or peace activities related to the struggle, the militia
136played a crucial role in mobilizing the required support. Such support ranged from
supplying food and water during battles, burying the dead, carrying the wounded to
safety and transporting war materials across rough terrain.
The Second Internal Crisis (Hinfishfish)54
In the two trying years of 1977 and 1978, the TPLF had to endure the onslaughts by the
larger EDU force on the one hand and by the Dergue on the other. Furthermore, internal
dissent was hatched by some of the Front’s educated members (high school and
university students). The struggle against the EDU in particular was tiring, because it was
a movement armed with modern weapons and numerically superior – over ten times
larger in number than the TPLF army and operating in the same territory. In addition, the
EDU was getting military advice and intelligence from the ELF, a veteran front which
knew the local territory very well. As this situation appeared to become unbearable, many
fighters began raising questions, among them about the calibre of the TPLF leadership to
guide the struggle. This clandestine movement of dissent emerging from within
eventually caused a breakdown in morale and led to the defection of several fighters,
which in turn drove the organization to near collapse. Since the dissent did not emerge in
open forums and was simmering as gossip, it was labelled Hinfishfish (‘disruption’ or
‘anarchy’).
Parallel to the emergence of the EDU as an imposing force, a few members of the
educated section of the TPLF started to form a network and began advancing, among
themselves, issues directed against the leadership of the TPLF. To air their discontent
they used informal, person-to-person contact, thereby rallying dissenters. The cadre
school sessions, seminars and congresses could have been used to air this discontent, but
since these forums were run by either members of the leadership or their deputies, who
54 For the TPLF version of the story which puts the blame squarely on the activists of the
Hinfishfish, see TPLF, ‘Fitsametat-Woyyanena’, (Tigrigna, 1978 E.C.), pp. 123-126
137themselves were the targets of the denunciation, the dissenters chose not to use them. At
the base area of Bumbet, issues related to sectarianism, authoritarian practices and
undemocratic culture within the Front were raised in a general meeting but they were
answered authoritatively by TPLF leaders on the spot and the discord seemed to be
resolved. Most of the charges were brought by veteran members, like Hailu Mengesha
and his uncle Abebe Tessema, but only a few of the charges had grounds to argue on.
Hailu Mengesha was one of the founders of the TPLF but he was well-known for his
maverick character and never abided by the rules and norms that governed the leadership.
He was consequently removed from his leadership post at the first Fighters’ Congress in
Deima in February 1976. It is true that when the dissent, instigated by a leading member,
arose behind the leadership’s back, it was natural for it to emerge as a power struggle, to
which the TPLF leadership responded harshly.
The points of discontent that were spreading amongst the rank-and-file fighters
varied in content and impact, depending in part on the attitudes and regional origin of the
individual or group. Although the dissenters came from all the different districts in Tigrai
and targeted a leadership that was also composed of members from most of the same
districts, the charges were constructed on a regional or district basis. Some accused the
leadership of coming only from three western districts, namely Adwa, Shire and Aksum,
for which they coined a derogatory word ‘ASHA’. They also said that the politico-
military activities of the Front focused only on these three districts, implying that the
eastern and southern regions, which the detractors claimed to represent, were ignored.
The controversial measures taken against the TLF were brought out in this context, i.e.
ASHA vs. the other districts of Tigrai, although leaders of this organization also came
from all over Tigrai. Yohannes Tekle-Haimanot, chairman of the TLF, for instance was
from Feresmai, Adwa. Others blamed the leadership for inaptitude and for leading them
into wars they could not win with outdated weapons they named erfe-meskel, a wooden
handle of a big cross. The war with the seemingly mighty EDU, which caused so much
havoc for the TPLF, was their case in point. Still others denounced the leadership because
of the unequal treatment of members; they spoke of loyalty as a criterion over merit to
138promote individual fighters to a higher position in the Front. They also criticized the
application of the Front’s rules and regulations over those who violated them as unfair
and discriminatory, especially in reference to Meles Zenawi, for the lenient punishment
he received as a result of his behaviour in the battles of Adwa and Adi-Daero. With
regard to these last cases, they had valid points, although it was presented in the usual
covert way. In a village called Kotsalo, Shire, for instance, initiated by a member of the
leadership, Zenawi was summoned before company no. 11 to answer accusations about
his failure in coordinating the operation at Adwa police station. But no one was putting
the allegation in strong enough terms to influence the verdict that would follow.
Apparently, the decision of the leadership at the time helped him to walk away with a
light punishment. Acquiescent of Wolde-Selassie Asfaw (1992: 33), who wrote: ‘It
would be wrong to assume that there was no reason for the opposition (the dissenters) to
complain about the leadership’s dictatorship’, one should add that prevalence of the
Stalinist ideological stance in the thinking of the leadership had created a situation where
any divergence of views was not tolerated.55 Yet, there were also unfounded and
sensational allegations from the dissenters that shocked the organization to the verge of
collapse. The allegations by and large were far from ideological or political challenges.
Before the leadership realized the seriousness of the matter, many fighters deserted
to Sudan and even back to government-held territories. The harshness of guerrilla life
coupled with gruelling battles acted as a catalyst in aggravating the crisis. As to the
allegations, one could closely examine their validity and would be forced to discard most
of them as mere concoctions. Let us have a look at some of the allegations and see if they
have anything to do with the conduct of the leadership. One was that members of the
leadership belonged to the three western districts and were paying attention only to these
three districts. This was incorrect. In the first place, the leaders at that time were young
55 The intolerance to opposition ideas was later clearly reflected in the constitution of the MLLT,
chapter I; section B (Le), no. 3. Accordingly, one should first get the permission of the CC to
express his/her ideas in public or pass through a chain of units beginning at basic (local)
organization, then going higher to woreda, zoba and region, and at each stage securing more than
50% support votes.
139revolutionaries who upheld Marxism and the class struggle as ultimate guides to the
solution of the Ethiopian people’s problems and considered the struggle of national self-
determination as a timely tactic for achieving the former goal. In this case the leaders
would not reduce themselves to district politicians, as this would be both theoretically
wrong and undermine their wider ideological appeal. As Wolde-Selassie (1992: 32) put
it, ‘They were radicals who transcended this issue comfortably’. Secondly, certainly
many of the leaders were born or grew up in one or the other of the three western
districts. However, this by no means indicated that they only ‘belonged’ to this area, and
in fact some of them had their roots in the southern districts. Regarding the third point,
the struggle had to start somewhere in the western part of Tigrai for reasons discussed in
Chapter 1, and had to grow gradually as it did, eventually to cover every part of Tigrai.
Naturally, people in these districts were prone to the influence and accessibility of the
Front. This situation created the condition for many young students and peasants from the
region to join the Front in large numbers. Contrary to accusations, the Front was forced to
return some of them while letting recruits from the rest of the districts join, in a process
of positive discrimination. So, the blame surrounding this point was unrealistic. The
allegation of going to war with outdated rifles should not have arisen at all, for it was
obviously clear from the beginning that the war was going to be protracted and starting
from scratch against a well-established and much stronger government army. Everybody
knew in advance or during the training period about this uphill struggle and the tenacity it
required. Guerrilla warfare of the type Mao Tse-Tung applied in his war of liberation was
adopted as the best tactic to compensate for the weakness of the Front. Such tactics as hit
and run, ambush and surprise attack were conducted mostly at night and with high
mobility but this required great endurance, which some of the critics did not like.
It was difficult for the leaders to respond to covert allegations, for no one was
forthcoming with concrete charges. Even when some of the leaders attempted to bring a
case into the open for scrutiny, no one was there to argue or take on the leaders,
understandably for fear of reprisal. This fear must have been created as a result of the
140lack of democratic practices in a Front that was preoccupied with military matters in
facing war on two fronts and where strict military discipline had to be observed.
One could continue to discuss the multiple allegations put forward by the critics.
While most of these allegations were unfounded, the detractors who kindled them, for
often personal reasons, made them appear true. The appeal was so sensational that many
fighters found it hard to avoid or rationally assess its credibility. Yet one cannot escape
the fact that there were certain legitimate issues that swayed many innocent fighters to the
side of the main detractors. Of course, as said, the complaints could have been resolved
through open discussion had the culture of democratic debate been in place, and many
fighters would not have then deserted. It was unfortunate that fighters fled to areas under
the Dergue, the very enemy these young folk set out to fight. Still more tragic was the
fact that many of these combatants became the source of information and weapons for the
Dergue, and eventually organized and were forced to fight the Front they once wanted to
be a democratic and successful organization.
In early 1978, the leadership decided to investigate the Hinfishfish at a big meeting
of leading fighters, called Wetaderawi Baito (Military Council). It was a prelude to a
campaign of cleansing before holding an organizational congress. Abbay Tsehay, the
head of the TPLF’s political committee, chaired the council.
The hardest and most sensitive part of the Hinfishfish was the manner in which it
was resolved. Although the entire membership of the leadership had a similar stand on
the Hinfishfish, it was Sibhat Nega who was in charge of the investigation and the
verdicts that followed. Those who were exposed in their units to be the main detractors
were sent to prison. After months of interrogation, some recanted and were set free to
resume their struggle, while many others who did not wish to do so had a sad ending;
regrettably they were killed for their dissent by people who claimed to fight the Dergue,
an enemy of dissent. Only a handful of CC members who were stationed in the base areas
knew about these harsh, irreversible measures.
141Words and Bullets – Battles with the EPRP56
Leading elements in both the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Party (EPRP) and the
TPLF were off-shoots of the Ethiopian student movement. Their political language was
more or less the same Marxist rhetoric, both advocating ‘the right of nations to self-
determination including and up to secession’, at the same time crying for socialist
transformation (for details see Kiflu Tadesse 1993: 117). To both groups, Ethiopia was a
prison of numerous nationalities whose freedom could be attained in a democratic
Ethiopia. To achieve this objective, the EPRP sought first a unity of struggle under its
party, while the TPLF gave primacy to the components of the whole. In the events
leading to the armed struggle, a series of consultations among the radicals in both groups
was taking place in the cities, particularly in Addis Ababa, as to how the Ethiopian Left
should be organized to play a leading role in the revolutionary transformation of Ethiopia.
Cordial dialogue with the intent of exploring the right form of struggle and organization
had been on going (ibid.: 140-41) for a while, for instance, between Giday Zeratsion
(TPLF) and Getachew Maru (EPRP), between Aregawi Berhe (TPLF) and Haile Abbay
and Birhane Eyassu (both EPRP). But there was one sensitive area where the two sides
had different views: the form of the struggle. While the TPLF believed in waging a
protracted armed struggle from the rural area, the EPRP side was focused on insurrection
from the urban areas. This difference was again a reflection of the divergent analysis of
the nature and effectiveness of the military establishment of the Dergue. How the
national movements should be organized and led was another sticky issue, where the
EPRP showed the tendency to control such movements under their multinational
organization while the TPLF was adamant about its independent existence. Without
reaching a conclusive agreement, both sides went their own ways to launch the struggle.
56 For details of the differences between the EPRP and the TPLF, see also Ye-Tigil Tiri, a bi-
monthly journal of the TPLF foreign committee, vol. 1, no. 2 (March 1977 E.C.), vol. 1, no. 1
(September 1977 E.C.), vol. 1, no. 3 (May 1977 E.C.), and Ehapana Ye-Ethiopia Abyot, TPLF,
April 1972 E.C.
142The next time the groups came face to face was in early 1975, in one of the
EPLF’s military training camps, Riesi Adi, in Eritrea. The TPLF group led by Mussie
took the initiative to contact the EPRP group led by Berhane-Meskel Reda, a Tigraian
who considered self-determination to be a side issue. The EPLF facilitated the meeting
and a host of issues, including the nature of the Dergue and the question of democracy,
were raised and discussed amicably. At last the need for a national struggle, which the
TPLF had gone so far towards, was raised but to the dismay of Mussie and his group,
Berhane-Meskel held the position that the national struggle was an ‘obstruction of the
proletarian revolution’ on which his party was to embark. The implication of this
position, which was revealed in the following months of struggle, was that the national
movement had to be either held by the EPRP or relinquished altogether. The meeting
ended not only without bearing any fruit but also leaving sour feelings and with
premonitions of a bleak future for their relationship. A few days later, both groups headed
for Tigrai – the EPRP to Assimba in Agame (northeast Tigrai) and the TPLF group to
Dedebit in Shire (northwest Tigrai), where the main group had established a base area.
In August 1975, the EPRP declared its political programme, which appeared to be
democratic and accommodative. Taking account of the EPRP’s programme, many
members of the TPLF seriously believed some kind of working agreement could be
reached in the fight against the Dergue. Undeterred by the hostile reaction of Berhane-
Meskel and keen to establish a working relationship with the EPRP against the common
enemy, the TPLF leadership sent a delegation led by Agazi and Seyoum from Dedebit to
Assimba, where EPRP leaders could be found. It was a one-sided initiative where the
other side had no prior notification, so the response of the EPRP was therefore reluctant.
Later, in October 1975, the TPLF invited the EPRP to Marwa in Agame, a base area of
the former. The delegation from the EPRP was composed of Tsegay Gebremedhin
(Debteraw), Abdisa Ayana (Roba), Berhane Iyasu and Getahune Sisay. On the TPLF
side, Zeru Gesesse, Giday Zeratsion, Abbay Tsehaye and Aregawi Berhe were present.
The discussion started with exploratory queries, both sides desperate to know the position
of the other on various strategic and tactical matters of the struggle. Towards the end of
143the discussion, the TPLF side suggested that the wider region of Ethiopia south of Tigrai
become the area of operation for the EPRP and Tigrai left for the TPLF. This suggestion
was meant to avoid any type of competitiveness that might lead to unnecessary
confrontation or even armed clash. Since it transgressed upon their rights to operate in
Tigrai, the EPRP group was infuriated by the suggestion. The atmosphere in the meeting
dramatically changed. The TPLF group tried hard to explain the intent of the suggestion
but the EPRP seemed never to want to listen, as if they were looking for an excuse to
blame the TPLF. In fact, later on the EPRP used this very point to accuse the TPLF of
‘narrow nationalism’. Thus the meeting ended in disaster.
Although not much was said about the contentious political positions in the
leaders’ meeting at Marwa, the cadres of both organizations engaged in heated debate
wherever and whenever they met. In general, each side claimed it had correctly analysed
the Ethiopian political situation and had adopted the corresponding form of struggle,
implying that the other side had the wrong line. This trend of self-centred superiority was
rampant among all revolutionary or Marxist groups of the time in general, and among
those two Fronts in particular. As a ‘revolutionary party of the proletariat’, the EPRP
believed it was waging a class struggle that would liberate every oppressed class or
nationality in the country. Therefore a national movement for self-determination, like that
of the TPLF, unless guided by their party (EPRP) ‘would play a counter-revolutionary
role’ and they thus considered the TPLF as a ‘reactionary, feudal party’. If we extend the
revolutionary logic, the TPLF was characterized as the enemy of the revolution and had
to be dealt with. The TPLF, on the other hand, believed that its formation was a direct
reflection of the existing contradictions within Ethiopian society and any party that did
not recognize this objective reality was not on track to resolve one of the fundamental
problems of Ethiopia. It therefore referred to the EPRP as a ‘petty bourgeois chauvinist
party’ no better than the ruling class that oppressed Tigrai, hence an enemy to fight.
These notions were deeply engrained in the thinking of most senior members of both
organizations. And finally it was this notion that would lead to the unnecessary war that
took the lives of many young Ethiopians and not because of one or the other provocation
144that later surfaced as a result of the ideologically charged premise. Explaining the
position of his party, Fassika Bellete, an EPRP CC member, said57:
The fundamental cause of the conflict between the EPRP and the TPLF in 1978
was ideological incompatibility. The EPRP was formed as a left-wing, radical
organization committed to establish a socialist political system over the whole of
Ethiopia. For the EPRP, the primary contradiction within Ethiopian society at the
time was class contradictions and the resolution of the class contradictions was the
main objective of the organization. EPRP has also tried to address the problem of
nationalities by recognizing the principle of rights of nationalities and espousing
the doctrine of unity through equality. TPLF was formed as a narrow nationalist
organization. Although modified later, its programme of 1976 clearly stated that
the organization’s main objective was the liberation of Tigray from the rest of
Ethiopia and the formation of an independent state. It has also aspired to be the
sole representative of the Tigray people. This ideological rift between the two
organizations was the fundamental reason for the armed conflicts that led to the
major war between the two in the late 1970s.
Amid these allegations and counter-allegations, some emotion-driven fighters were
exceeding the limits of the debate and threatened armed confrontation. Yet, some of the
leaders of both organizations came forward to calm this risky game and conducted
meetings to create a better understanding. These meetings, however, never changed the
confrontational atmosphere that persisted at this time.
In January 1976 such a meeting was convened on the advice of and under pressure
from the EPLF, who obviously understood the benefit for their own struggle against the
Dergue. Both the EPRP and the TPLF agreed at least to peacefully coexist and eventually
explore areas of cooperation. Despite these agreements, the actual relationship was
drifting from bad to worse. Enraptured by their organizational dreams, cadres and
57 Interview, 10 August 2003, Washington, DC.
145combatants of both fronts were increasingly becoming involved in heated debates
capitalizing on their differences rather than putting the emphasis on points of common
interest. In some cases, the debates became so emotionally charged that they led to armed
confrontation. Leaders on both sides did not make enough serious efforts to mitigate the
gradually deteriorating relationship. Some of the leaders, including Sibhat Nega, were
said even to have given their tacit go-ahead for confrontations rather than endeavouring
to put an end to them or calm the volatile situation.58
The people of the surrounding areas, especially those of Agame and Adwa, were
the main targets of mobilization. Day and night, cadres were out organizing and creating
underground cell structures to perform organizational missions that aimed at denying
support for the other fronts. Occasionally, the people were not only agitated but also
pressurized to shift their loyalty from organization to organization. Permits to travel from
region to region or to enemy-held (Dergue) towns and access to medical treatment in the
field were some of the soft tools used to keep people on the side of one or the other
organization. If a peasant was thought to be working aggressively or diligently for one of
the fronts, he/she might even end up being imprisoned or killed by the other. Freedom of
expression and the right to be a member of the party of one’s choice were tampered with
by the very organizations which were waging armed resistance ostensibly to defend these
democratic rights.
Again, in April 1977 formal negotiations started between the two organizations.
At their first meeting, both sides agreed to set up a conciliation committee that would
look into disputes whenever they arose, and settle them peacefully. This agreement led to
a second meeting where more substantive issues like the formation of a united democratic
front were raised and discussed. Both organizations even reached an understanding of the
nature and the process as to how the united front should be formed. They also outlined
details of creating the conditions for its realization. This apparently cordial relationship
and the subsequent negotiations continued from April to August 1977, but then collapsed.
This was partly because the EPRP had maintained the vanguard attitude that all member
58 Interview: Berhe Hagos, Ottawa, 27 August 2003 and Tesfay Atsbaha, Köln, 25 March 2004.
146organizations of the united front should acknowledge the party (EPRP) as their leader
(see Declarations of the Party’s CC 4th Plenum) – a position the TPLF vehemently
opposed.
The abruptly elevated enthusiasm of the EPRP at this point were interpreted by the
TPLF as motivated by other, dishonest factors. The TPLF by then believed that the EPRP
had lost all its support and was isolated from the people of Tigrai and so by forming an
alliance in a united front it might enjoy the acceptance the TPLF had acquired. In a twist
of events, it had now become the turn of the TPLF to show reluctance to create a working
relationship with the EPRP against the common enemy. Both fronts continued to play
political games without seriously engaging in meaningful discussion that could enable
them to achieve unity for the collective good, although Fassika Bellete insisted that
‘EPRP leaders took the process of the negotiations as a genuine effort to mitigate the
conflict between the two parties’ and that ‘they considered the TPLF as a democratic
organization and proposed merger, broad alliance or peaceful co-existence’ (ibid.).
Members of both fronts were harassing and also killing active supporters and
fighters of the other – measures that could not be executed by and large without the prior
knowledge of the leaders. For instance in the town of Enticho, an EPRP contingent killed
a civilian and wounded a TPLF fighter while working in their clinic. On the other hand, a
TPLF fighter nicknamed Gadafi killed an EPRP fighter in a village near Sobiya and fled
to Adigrat, a Dergue-occupied town at the time. Similar attacks and acts of sabotage were
also carried out now and then in Dergue-occupied towns. When the Dergue planned the
Campaign of ‘Red Terror’ on its alleged opponents in the town of Adwa, clandestine
members of both fronts in the Dergue were aware of whose supporters were singled out.
As it came clear that TPLF supporters were the targets of the Red Terror, the secret
members of the TPLF, led by Wolde-Selassie Girmay, organized the killing of the
leading group of the campaign of which EPRP members were a part. It was no longer a
secret that the Dergue was infiltrated by EPRP members from top to bottom with the
intention of overthrowing the incumbent regime from within.
147Finally, in February 1978, while a meeting of the conciliatory committee was in
progress, an EPRP contingent carried out a raid on the TPLF clinic in Aaiga, Agame,
killing one fighter and wounding two others. The next day, EPRP forces began encircling
a TPLF platoon based in Sobiya. After a hasty mobilization of its militia and active
supporters, the TPLF platoon retreated to the nearby district of Adwa, where it was better
established at the time. The withdrawal of the TPLF units and its militia from the region
of Agame was a military as well as a political blow to the TPLF. Its supporters now
began feeling abandoned and defenceless. To take advantage of the imbalance of forces
in that region, the EPRP began pursuing the retreating forces of the TPLF. The EPRP
went on attacking other isolated TPLF units outside Agame, leaving them with no option
but to engage in a defensive war. In Merieto and Bizet, TPLF forces defended their
positions inflicting heavy losses on the attacking forces of the EPRP. The TPLF remained
defensive, for its main forces were still engaged in war with the EDU in western Tigrai,
but the EPRP, aware of this imbalance, was keen to push the war to its extreme limit.
What the EPRP failed to realize was that, in December 1977, the TPLF had inflicted a
decisive blow on the EDU and was engaged in mop-up operations. Although exhausted
by a year-long war against the EDU, TPLF forces had emerged from the war with high
morale and great fighting spirit and extensive experience.
Two TPLF companies were pulled from the west to the central region and, in
April 1978, the EPRP forces encountered them at Azeba. Now that the fighting skills of
the TPLF forces were much superior to those of their adversary, the EPRP forces lost not
only the battle but also the initiative and were forced to retreat to their base area in
Assimba. At this juncture, the real war between the EPRP and the TPLF began. It was the
turn of the TPLF to chase away the EPRP forces not only from their area of operation but
also from their base areas of Assimba and Alitena. There was no stiff resistance as the
TPLF forces rolled on through the rough terrain of northern Agame, the EPRP-held
territory and base areas. In a series of battles that took less than two weeks, the whole
EPRP force in the central region was defeated. About fifty were taken prisoner of war
and the rest were forced to retreat to the ELF-held territory inside Eritrea and sought ELF
148protection. No wonder then that the ELF, which was aiding the EDU in western Tigrai
against the TPLF, now grabbed the opportunity of supporting the EPRP in its perilous
days, with the strategic aim of weakening, if not destroying, the TPLF.
The defeated EPRP army retreated from the eastern part of Tigrai through ELF-
held territory to Awgaro in Eritrea across western Tigrai. The ELF supplied them with
the necessary materials to recuperate and reorganize the available forces. During this
period, many of the fighters who lost faith in their leadership abandoned the EPRP and
ended up in Sudan as refugees. The ELF, which always grabbed any opportunity to
weaken the TPLF, this time began encouraging and helping the EPRP to launch an attack
on the western front of the TPLF through Bademe. They even deployed some of their
contingents with EPRP forces. At Gemahlo, a strategic point between Bademe and
Sheraro, a fierce battle raged between the TPLF and the combined forces of the EPRP
and the ELF. After a day of fierce fighting, the combined forces of ELF/EPRP were
defeated and were forced to retreat to where they had come from across the Mereb River,
way beyond Bademe. Their plan was to crush the TPLF forces in western Tigrai and
enable the EPRP to establish a base area in Wolkait across the Tekeze River, from which
it could launch successive attacks on the TPLF. The plan collapsed and from there on
they had to stay away from TPLF forces. Consequently, they had to travel further west on
Eritrean territory and crossed to the highlands of Wolkait. In the meantime, many EPRP
fighters stopped fighting and left the organization, the bulk of whom went to Sudan to
seek asylum.
The TPLF, knowing in advance of the EPRP’s plans to cross to Wolkait to
reorganize and launch attacks from there, began preparations to pursue the demoralized
EPRP army before it recovered from the shocks and injuries inflicted in earlier defeats.
The TPLF was well acquainted with the people of Wolkait and had ample knowledge of
the rough terrain from their days of fighting the EDU. TPLF fighters like Mekonnen
Zelelow, who came from that area, and civilian members, like Hagos Atsbaha, had
already created an adequate network in support of the TPLF. So Wolkait would not be an
unfamiliar area of operation as the EPRP would have liked it to be. After all the defeats,
149desertions and long marches of retreat, it was only the most determined EPRP fighters
who remained in Wolkait to continue the struggle. Understandably, fighting against such
a committed group would not be an easy encounter. Nevertheless, the TPLF too was
determined to take the war with the EPRP to its final conclusion.
In November 1979 TPLF fighting forces crossed the River Tekeze and began
chasing EPRP units. Although they were posing as a restraining resistance, the EPRP
units were no match for the highly motivated and better-experienced TPLF fighting
companies. After a series of short battles that culminated with the retreat of EPRP units,
in December 1979, the main forces of both antagonistic fronts in the region finally met at
Shirela. This time, it was the EPRP units who took the initiative to attack and inflicted
heavy losses on the TPLF. Martha (Kahsu), a woman commander of a TPLF unit, and
some others were killed in this battle. After almost a day of fierce fighting, however, the
resilience and fighting skills of the TPLF units exceeded those of the EPRP forces and
the battle came to an end with the crushing defeat of the EPRP. The remaining EPRP
units could not sustain their positions as the TPLF kept on striking with superior force.
Eventually all their units withdrew from the Wolkait region and began to assemble in
Armacheho, a remote area further south. Thereafter, the EPRP ceased to function as a
military threat to the TPLF, while the TPLF continued to grow and challenge bigger
enemies like the Dergue. But had both organizations, who had a similar ideological
posture, been endowed with the wisdom and farsightedness of settling disputes amicably,
a lot of young and dynamic lives would have been spared to fight a more meaningful war
against the common enemy, the tyranny of the Dergue that was responsible for the death
of tens of thousands of Ethiopians during the Red Terror, the shocks of which are still felt
by many Ethiopians today.
Besides the uninterrupted and successive offensive of the TPLF, another main
reason for the defeat of the EPRP on the military front was stated in the declaration of its
own CC 4th plenum:
150Because the focus of the party leadership was on urban organizational work,
the army could not get a necessary guidance and leadership structure; the
leadership was unable to closely monitor the army’s mobility and progress.
This had a big impact on the development of the army and was a serious
weakness in the leadership at the highest level (translation from Amharic by
the author).
The defeat of the EPRP on the military front gave the TPLF the opportunity to focus on
the main enemy, the military government of the Dergue, and broaden its area of operation
further to the south to Wollo and Gondar.
Summary
The establishment and subsequently the strength of the TPLF in the field of the struggle,
the countryside, were upgraded from what we saw in the previous chapter to a higher
level in very short period of time. To mobilize, organize and administer the peasant
majority, a number of departments specializing on different tasks were created. Utilizing
ethnic nationalism as the core method of mobilization with its anticipated achievement of
self-determination and at the same time by rooting out the rampancy of shiftas (bandits)
and driving rival forces like EDU and EPRP out of Tigrai, the TPLF began to establish to
what social scientists like David Pool (1992) and Christopher Clapham (1998) refer as
‘movement hegemony’ in the rural areas of Tigrai. The counter-offensive of government
forces to nip the TPLF in the bud – a series of punitive campaigns that by-and-large came
upon the peasant masses who were accused as hosts of the guerrilla fighters - definitely
helped to bring closer the Front and the people as never before.
In the name of ‘democratic centralism’ and with no less harsh measures of dealing
with its rival forces, internal dissent in the TPLF was suppressed, for it was considered
counter-revolutionary activity that could ruin the whole organization. Such stringent
151measures enabled the leadership to enforce internal disciple and to execute its politico-
military objectives as planned. Thus the prevalence of the TPLF at this stage of the
struggle was attained by its rigorous mobilization of the people based on the urge of
ethno-nationalist self-determination on the one hand and the enforcement of strict internal
discipline of its rank and file that able to take on rival forces decisively.
152Chapter 6
The Military Government (Dergue) and the TPLF
Introduction
Keeping in mind the historical factors that shaped ethnic polarization and conflict in
Ethiopia as a background, this chapter backs the contention that the national movement in
Tigrai under the TPLF surfaced, developed and toppled the military regime partly as a
consequence of the overbearing policies the latter pursued towards ethno-regional groups /
nationalities in Ethiopia that sought autonomy as opposed to rigid centralism. To secure a
‘revolutionary democratic’ image in the initial process of its consolidation, the military
government brought forth the issue of ‘self-determination to nationalities’ as a legitimate
demand and a right of oppressed ethnic groups. However, bent on its authoritarian ultra-
nationalist ideology, the regime was opposed to all types of nationalist movements, popular
or not.
In the theoretical discussion advanced in Chapter 2, it was argued that a regime that
responds to the demands of people with repression will likely intensify the hostility and
thus speed up its own destruction (Gurr 1970; Goldstone 1991; Clapham 1998). The
conduct of the Ethiopian Dergue, demonstrated the validity of this postulate. This will be
discussed in light of the politico-military confrontation between the Dergue on the one
hand and the various national fronts, with the emphasis on the TPLF, on the other.
Owing to the fluidity of ethnic nationalism, there were deeply felt controversies
among the policy makers of the TPLF over the theory and practice of ethnicity and the
quest for ethno-national self-determination, starting from the very beginning of the armed
struggle. The consequences of these controversies were dire, not only on narrowing the
scope of the struggle but also on retarding the speed of victory. The ideological and
153political controversies will be discussed in detail in the next chapter 7. In this chapter
though, these differences will be treated in a way to show that they had direct bearings on
the military as well as political strategies and tactics to be pursued in the struggle against
the Ethiopian government. The last section of this chapter focuses on the controversies
surrounding the struggle for the ‘right to national self-determination’ as it played out in
formulating the Front’s military strategies and their application, and indicate how it
impacted on the out come of the struggle.
The Dergue on the National Question
First, a look at some aspects of the historical background to the national question in
Ethiopia, touching upon the origins of ethnic conflicts, the related movements, and cases
with the potential for conflict when the military government, officially called Provisional
Military Administrative Council (PMAC), took power. Later, the evolution of the TPLF is
considered as it encountered the military regime. It should be borne in mind that the
PMAC, commonly known as the Dergue (an old Amharic word for ‘Committee’), was a
collection of middle and low-ranking military officers who spontaneously joined together
during the 1974 February revolution when a political vacuum was created as a result of the
demise of the Haile Selassie regime. As Clapham (1988: 39) rightly observed: ‘The armed
forces were initially no more united or prepared than any section of the civilian
population’, but the hierarchical structure that connected them and perhaps the inspiration
they inherited from the generals who attempted a coup in 1960, all coupled with their
movement for salary increase, helped them to be in the forefront of the revolution.
Instantaneously, the Dergue was mobilized by Atnafu Abate and Taffera Taclaeb from the
Fourth Division (Halliday and Molyneux 1981: 86), with the headquarters of the army
based in the centre of Addis Ababa. Both held the rank of major and were bringing in
officers of the same rank and below from all over the country. In a dramatic development,
lt.-col. Mengistu Haile-Mariam from the 3rd Division in Harrar, ‘who distinguished himself
154by a fiery speech at the first Dergue conclave’ (ibid.), on 28 June 1974 joined them and
later on became their leader. Four days later on 2 July, the Dergue, consisting of 10959
members, announced its hastily prepared programme and took power, ruling the country
with long periods of mayhem and bloodshed for the next seventeen years.
The fundamental historical drive for ethnic identification in Ethiopia resulted from
the general processes of state and nation formation in the region as a whole and that of the
modern state in Ethiopia in particular. The conflicts along the ethnic divide emerged and
developed not so much from the sheer expansion of the central Ethiopian state as from the
radical changes in social and economic organization that followed in its wake. Those in
power obviously exercised political, social and economic hegemony, while others (the
ethnic nationalities, including the ordinary populace of the dominant nationality) in most
cases lived in conditions of oppression, subjection and humiliation. The modern state
continued to build upon this foundation while Haile Selassie intensified the process of
modernization since the late 1930s. By that time, the country had already joined the world
capitalist market and a bureaucratic ruling elite dependent on the West had evolved,
intensifying the process of centralization to meet the new interests of the ruling class. As
Goulborne (1991: 233) observed for Africa in general,
A unitary political system has been seen as the cornerstone of national unity,
which in turn, was necessary for development. Typically, this political system
has been characterized by the single political party, a strong executive
presidency, with the national army, police force, and administration each
owing allegiance to the party and president. Political pluralism was therefore
perceived to be anathema to African traditions; pluralism was divisible where
African village democracy was unitary. To one degree or another, political
pluralism was, and remains, suspect throughout most of the continent.
59 The names of the 109 Dergue members can be found in ‘Neber’ (Amharic) by Zenebe Feleke,
1996 E.C. and in ‘YeLetena Colonel Mengistu Hailemariam Tizitawoch, (Amharic) by Genet
Ayele Anbesie, 1994 E.C.
155This state of affairs caused ethnic rebellions. Eritrea posed a different problem to the
Ethiopian state, for it had since 1941 been under the jurisdiction of the United Nations and
the British after the defeat of the Italians there.
By the time the military government took power in 1974, the Eritrean liberation
struggle had entered its 13th year, two border wars were fought between Ethiopia and
Somalia on the question of the Ogaden, where ethnic Somalis demanded self-
determination, and revolts had occurred in Tigrai (1942-1943), Sidamo (1960s), Gojjam
(1963), Bale (1965-1967) and some other places (see Gebru Tareke 1991; Markakis 1990;
Clapham 1988; Gilkes 1975). Such was the state and nature of the ethnic problem that the
military government inherited: conflicts that were both current and potentially possible.
The policies pursued by the new government to ‘resolve’ the ethnically based and other
rural questions would become repressive as the years went by.
From the first days of its constitution in June 1974 until the proclamation of the
‘National Democratic Revolution’ (NDR) programme in April 1976, and despite its
rhetoric about a radical revolution and class conflict, the Dergue had neither renounced nor
criticized the positions of the old regime on the national question. Nor had its members had
a clear position on the issue other than that of maintaining the country's unity and territorial
integrity in the old way. In a nutshell, on the question of the right to self-determination or
self-rule by ethnic nationalities, the Dergue’s position was in substance no different from
its predecessor. Fred Halliday and Maxine Molyneux (1981: 262) wrote that ‘…the
continuation of chauvinism at the centre was concealed behind an apparently faultless
rhetoric of class conflict’. There is support for this contention: there was its slogan Itioppia
Tikdem (‘Ethiopia First’); it turned a deaf ear to ethno-national plights; its first chairman,
General Aman M. Andom (of Eritrean origin), was most likely assassinated for ‘leniency’
on the Eritrean question; there was a terror and assassination campaign against Eritreans in
the urban areas; military offensives were resumed in February 1975 in Eritrea against rebel
156positions while they were demanding a peaceful settlement of their question60; and
prominent Oromo nationalist leaders such as General Tadesse Biru and Kebede Bizuneh
(March 1975) were executed, as were Tigraian radicals like Meles Tekle, Rezene Kidane,
Abraha Hagos and Gidey Gebre-Wahid (March 1975). All this happened before the
declaration of the NDR programme. Markakis and Ayele (1978: 119) summed up the
character of the military regime in its first year in power as follows: ‘The wanton manner
of the executions and the inclusion of military radicals in the massacre shocked many
Ethiopians.... The revolution is no longer bloodless, and ruthlessness increasingly marks its
course from now on.’ No matter how loudly the Dergue’s slogan ‘Ethiopia Tikdem’
resonated, as early as 1976 opposition to the military regime was already gathering
momentum in the urban and the rural areas, leading to armed struggle by different fronts.
Although the April 1976 NDR programme proclaimed self-determination for the
various nationalities, the Dergue was organizing its infamous ‘Razza project’, a peasant-
army march, mainly on Eritrea but also including Tigrai. that would be launched the
following month. The Razza project, which is discussed at length later on, turned into a
massacre of ill-armed peasants sent to the well-armed rebels as cannon fodder, The
campaign, as Halliday put it, ‘… was not only intrinsically inconsistent with any prospect
of conciliation that might have been raised by the NDR and Nine Point proclamations; it
was also marked by the revival of themes redolent of the chauvinist campaigns of the
imperial past, with the Christian peasants being rallied to fight off Muslim invaders’ (ibid.:
163). While this latter remark may be simplifying things, despite the article on self-
determination in the NDR programme, the above-mentioned incidents indicate that the
Dergue had not moved an inch from the positions held by the ancien régime on the
national question, but even aggravated them.
60 See EPLF’s November 13, 1973 declaration of 7 points on a peaceful resolution (in EPLF,
January 1980).
157Eritrea
Neither the Dergue as a body nor its leaders individually, with the exception of Captain
Moges Wolde-Michael, had a prudent viewpoint on the national question in general and on
the Eritrean problem in particular different from and/or critical of that of the imperial
regime. Captain Moges was later killed by Mengistu’s assassins for his position on the
question of nationalities. The same day, 3 February 1977, the PMAC Chairman General
Teferi Banti and Captain Alemayehu Haile were also killed; ‘all of whom in December
1976 had attempted to restrict the power of Mengistu and Atnafu Abate’ (Schwab 1985:
37). The Dergue was devoted to the old policies but with a difference, namely in language
and ideological discourse that it used to legitimize its claims and the ‘solutions’ it put
forward. It argued that the Eritrean people had the same enemies as their Ethiopian
counterparts: ‘feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism and imperialism’ and the fact that they
did not need to fight for self-determination. This was an approach that negated the essence
of the movement in Eritrea. In this respect, the fact that the new Ethiopian regime’s first
chairman, but not a an original member of the Dergue, General Aman Andom, was
Eritrean by origin was the leverage that was used. Detesting the Italian occupation of
Eritrea, Aman’s parents had lived in Sudan where he was born and educated. Upon the
return of Emperor Haile Selassie from exile through Sudan, Aman as a young military
officer accompanied the Emperor and came back to Ethiopia where he built his career and
became a renowned general. He led the Ethiopian army to victory in the 1964 Ogaden War
against Somalia. He was one of the commanding officers in the Korean War and was well-
known in the West. As a skilled general and a patriot, he was respected not only in the
army but also among ordinary Ethiopians. Because of his origins and negotiating skills,
Aman did a remarkable job in coming close to acquiring a peace settlement with Eritrean
rebels. ‘He never accepted independence but sought to negotiate with the two guerrilla
groups’ (Halliday 1981: 88). He warned ‘Those who advocate separation are enemies of
158the nation and must therefore be dealt in a stern manner’.61 The peace settlement would
have been useful to the Dergue and disadvantageous to the liberation movements, but
Mengistu, with his own personal ambitions, twisted the logic of the peace settlement Aman
was nurturing and had him killed in his home on 23 November 1974 by a hit squad. By
killing such an experienced Ethiopian general, who sought peaceful resolution to the
conflicts in the country, Mengistu, whose lust for power and personal fame was unbridled,
pushed Ethiopia on the road to break-up.
Mengistu's wing prevailed within the Dergue and reaffirmed a dogmatically
nationalist and authoritarian stance. In addition to a policy of terror against Eritreans in the
urban areas, the Dergue in February 1975 resumed a military offensive against rebel
positions. These two developments antagonized the Eritrean population and led thousands
of youngsters – including some from Addis Ababa University – to join the two liberation
movements, the ELF and the EPLF. As early as 1976, Anthony D. Smith (1976: 140)
observed ‘…where Eritrean nationalism is receiving immense impetus from the
circumstances of its repression by the Ethiopian army warns us that the creation of such
new nationalism results more often from testing in the crucible of suppression by a superior
government than from the mobilization of the population from below’. Even the leader of
the EPLF, Issayas Afeworki remarked that the Dergue swelled the ranks of the Eritrean
movements. The Eritrean-nationalist and the ethno-nationalist movements thus grew in
leaps and bounds, and ethnic mobilization and (violent) resistance became the dominant
means of confronting the Dergue. Below, we briefly discuss some of these movements.
The Ogaden
The organization that was active in the Ethiopian Ogaden, the Western Somalia Liberation
Front (WSLF), was in fact run by the government of Somalia. Ostensibly a nationalist
movement, the WSLF had substantively mobilized the people of the Ogaden at the
beginning of 1963, and its military activities had intensified by early 1977, when Mengistu
launched his coup and became the unchallenged head of the Dergue. In the summer, the
61 Ethiopian Herald, October 17, 1974
159Somali Republic invaded the Ogaden, clearing the ground for the third stage of the border
war between the two states. Mobilizing the people under the ‘call of the motherland’ and
supported by Cuban troops and a huge Soviet arsenal, the Dergue defeated the Somali
army and won back the Ogaden. Militarily, the Ogaden issue was settled in a relatively
short period of time but politically with the issue of self-determination embedded in it, an
uncertain long way ahead was awaiting. Since then, the ethno-nationalist movement for
self-determination, although dented, has never been away.
Oromo
The Oromo nationalist movement has a long and complex history which is beyond the
scope of this study. It dates back to the early 1960s and was based on ‘a common history of
central domination and exploitation. …From the mid 1960s onwards, attempts were made
by educated Oromos to articulate this awareness of domination into an Oromo ethnic
nationalism’ (Clapham 1988: 216). The activities of Mecha Tulama, an Oromo cultural and
development association, and later the insurgency in Bale (1963-70) led by Waku Guto
(see ibid.) were some of the movements that inspired and gave shape to the Oromo ethno-
nationalist upsurge. In the early 1970s an Oromo group that believed in the formation of ‘a
coalition and alliance of anti-feudal and anti-imperialist forces whose immediate task was
to overthrow the imperial autocratic regime’ (Yohannes Petros 1993: 6-7) formed the
Ethiopian National Liberation Front (ENLF). After 1972, Shaikh Hussen Sorra, Chairman
of ENLF, had close contacts with leaders of the Ethiopian Student Union in Europe who
later formed MEISON, the party that adopted the position of giving critical support to the
Dergue in the early years of the revolution. When the Dergue enacted its radical land
reform proclamation on 4 March 1975, the Oromo people, more than any other ethnic
group in the country, applauded it and MEISON, which had advocated less radical land
reform – confiscating the land of big land owners and dividing it among the landless
peasants (see Andargatchew Assegid 2000: 235) – nevertheless went on mobilizing the
Oromo peasants to support the reform and thus create their own social base. This was
followed by the establishment of peasant associations to organize collective farms and
160control the peasants, and to run a command economy. The Oromo people found this
collectivism repugnant but they wanted a political space to exercise their right to self-
determination which had been denied by the previous regime. Slowly but certainly the
elation and hope raised by the land reform were overtaken by the ethno-nationalists’ quest
for self-determination. The Dergue, however, did not budge on this issue and armed
struggle was looming. The Dergue's attitude towards any ethno-nationalist group opting for
the right to self-determination was hostile and aggressive, as was its reaction towards the
Oromo who raised this issue. It did everything to crush nationalist assertiveness among the
Oromos, whether in the form of an independent mass organization or a liberation front. It
eliminated Oromo personalities whom it suspected of being engaged in a nationalist
activity. Prominent Oromo activists like General Taddesse Biru, Mekonnen Wossenu and
many others were murdered in 1975 after serving long prison sentences. Such acts tended
to strengthen the adherence of many Oromo nationalists to the Oromo Liberation Front
(OLF), which had emerged early in 1974 amid the political turmoil. Many Oromo
intellectuals and university students who were part of the Ethiopian Left felt forced to join
the OLF or flee the country and become diaspora sympathizers.
The Afar and Sidama
Elsewhere in the country, some other ethno-nationalist fronts were formed to assert the
right of self-determination. The Afar in the northeast and the Sidama in the south were also
engaged in resistance that eventually evolved into ethno-nationalist movements with a
demand for autonomy or self-determination. The Afar nationalist movement has a long
history stretching back to the colonial era. The longevity of the movement is well-
documented by historians and Afar writers. As Abdallah Adou (1993: 44) put it: ‘The Afar
nation has never been subject to any external rule at any time prior to the Scramble for
161Africa…[it] had a long political history of self-rule and in fact, at times, powerful and
influential states/sultanates in the Horn of Africa’. 62
The Sidama movement goes back to the early 1960s, when local peasants demonstrated
for land reform. In 1978 Wolde-Emmanuel Dubale, Betena Holesha and Matias Meshona
led a nationalist movement known as Kaie, which means ‘revolt’, and which was later
called the Sidama Liberation Movement (SLM).63
Let us now look at the case of Tigrai, the focus of this study, in its evolving relationship
with the Dergue.
Tigrai
The Dergue soon revealed repressive policies towards Tigraians and their national
movement. This movement, tracing its historical roots to the Woyyane uprising of 1942-
43, had been simmering among educated and radical Tigraians since the 1960s. Later, in
early 1974 the Tigraian National Organization (TNO) was formed, the mother organization
of the TPLF, that was born on 18 February 1975 (see Chapter 3).
The people of Tigrai had hoped the downfall of Haile Selassie's regime would open
a new era of progress, mutual respect and equality, to resolve, among other things, ethnic-
based regional contradictions and allow the exercise the principle of self-determination or
achieve regional autonomy. The military regime, however, foiled these hopes. Rigid
centralism of the Stalinist kind, militarism and socio-political repression came to
characterize the Dergue and guided its policies to counter the ethno-nationalist movement.
Before even consolidating power in early 1975, the regime began imprisoning
hundreds of radical Tigraians who were participating in various social activities and
organizations, such as the teachers’ unions, the student movement and other social and

162professional associations. In March 1975, scores of radicals including Giday Gebre-Wahid,
Meles Tekle, Rezene Kidane and Abraha Hagos, were summarily killed without due
process of law, and some of the dead bodies were thrown into the main streets of the city
on display. The objective of such measures was to terrorize Tigraians and other rebels so
that they would be scared to raise their political demands for change.
On 20 December 1974, the Dergue declared ‘Ethiopia Tikdem’, the definition of
which was very elastic, comprising Ethiopian socialism, self-reliance, and the idea of the
indivisibility of Ethiopia, accompanied by the slogan ‘Ethiopia or Death’. ‘Ethiopia
Tikdem’ meant, in effect, the rejection of a pluralistic parliamentary system in which
various interest groups were represented in a struggle to determine national policy
(Ottaway 1978: 63). To the Tigraians, whose belief in a historical Ethiopia was deep-
rooted, the motto of Ethiopia Tikdem bore the message that their plight as an oppressed
nationality was seen as trivial if not reactionary and divisive. By this time, Tigraian
students in the H.S.I. University had decided to boycott the ‘Development through Co-
operation Campaign’, launched by the military government in 1975 and to prepare for
organized resistance. They soon turned their association, TNO, into a front, the TPLF.
In Tigrai, the existence of the TPLF was heralded by the first successful military
operation on 5 August 1975 in the town of End-Selassie (Shire), that secured the freedom
of a leading member of the movement, Mehari Tekle (Mussie) and of 21 other prisoners,
five months after the birth of the TPLF (see chapter 3). A month later another military
operation was conducted in the town of Aksum, where all government establishments and
in fact the whole town were put under the control of the TPLF for hours. Crowds cheered
as TPLF fighters marched through the streets..
Such acts of resistance hastened the Ethiopian regime to take aggressive measures
and pursue a military policy against the Tigraian population. The same year, Tigrai was
declared a military zone. Ground and air forces were sent in to combat the insurgents, in
the process devastating towns, villages, market areas, farmland, churches and mosques.
E.g., the villages of Abi Adi, Chila, Hawzien, Sheraro and Yechla were bombed on market
days with the aim being to destroy and intimidate. The Sunday Times journalist Jon Swain
163(1996: 224-25) in May 1976 observed: ‘From the village above Zerona (Tsorona), I
watched government jets wheel in the sky, hit the town and rake a goatherd on the hill with
cannon fire…. The frequent air attacks did have one important effect. They forced the
peasants to change the pattern of their lives. Now they slept during the day and worked in
the fields at night, when they were assured of empty skies.’ With such massive force,
however, the Dergue believed it could bring the people to submission.
In the course of the conflict, famine conditions emerged, not only because of policy
ineptness but also because of the Dergue’s logic of war: if the people were hungry they
could not supply food for the insurgents and would also turn to the government for hand-
outs, in which case it might be possible to control them. The organization Africa Watch,
which was closely monitoring the situation in Tigrai during this time, had this to report:
‘The nature of the rebellion in Tigrai led to a new variation on the army's counter-
insurgency strategies. These strategies were instrumental in setting the famine in train.
There were three main aspects:
(cid:190) Large scale military offensives, aimed at the surplus-producing Shire district…

The logic behind the government’s strategy was ‘draining the sea to catch the fish’. This
amounted to counter-population warfare’ (De Waal 1991: 140-41).
To make matters worse, in the late 1970s the regime came up with a resettlement
plan for regions of ethnic conflict such as Tigrai, where farmers were to be permanently
relocated against their will to new places. This was designed to destabilize ethnic and
social relations and impede the physical and psychological support the resistance
movement had gained. These policies, accompanied by propaganda, further aroused
bitterness among Tigraians against the government, and the nationalist movement gained
impetus. The policies of the Dergue thus came to serve as ammunition for the TPLF, and in
the eyes of the population justified the latter’s characterization of the Dergue as a
dictatorial force. More young peasants and students began to flock to the front, nurturing
164the growth of the TPLF from a small guerrilla band to a formidable mobile army supported
by a solid social base. In three to four years, TPLF forces grew so strong that the military
government, equipped with Soviet weapons, was forced to challenge the TPLF in huge
military campaigns.
From May 1976 onwards, the Dergue began launching these military campaigns
once or twice a year, attempting to destroy the TPLF and punish the people that it blamed
for supporting the Front. Between 1976 and 1980, there were six major campaigns
involving several ground force divisions, airborne troops, mechanized brigades, battery
units and air-force squadrons.. The devastation inflicted by the armed forces was intense.
Indeed these military campaigns changed the pattern of life of every inhabitant of the
region. However, by keeping its wits about the Dergue’s intentions, the TPLF was able to
adopt a different, plausible tactic that helped it not only overcome the military onslaughts
but also to ‘benefit’ from the campaigns and grow. By repeatedly attacking isolated enemy
contingents, TPLF guerrilla forces snatched new weapons and armed its militia and new
recruits. The rapid growth of the TPLF force from a band of no more than 20 guerrilla
fighters to an army with a deep-rooted social base and later organized in regular divisions
with heavy artillery and tanks, in addition to thousands of militia, can to a considerable
extent be attributed to the indiscriminate and brutal repression of the Dergue-led Ethiopian
army of the Tigraians. The assertion of many analysts, like Gurr (1970), Skocpol (1970),
Goodwin (1994), Wickham-Crowley (1994), Clapham (1998), and others that in certain
conditions of social inequality and political oppression violence invigorates counter-
violence by those against whom it is intended, finds adequate illustration in the case of
Dergue violence and the response of the people in Tigrai.
The TPLF Military Build-up
Initially nobody in the government or among the population seemed to take the TPLF
seriously. As we saw, the movement was initially a tiny guerrilla band of 10 men who
165were armed with 4 old-fashioned rifles and a pistol. They appeared to be an unknown,
adventurous group of radical university students tackling the impossible. The group was
able, however, to combine the theoretical understandings of various armed struggles
throughout the world and the practical wisdom of their forefathers, who fought the battles
of Gundet, Gurae, Dogali, Metema, Adwa and Maichew against foreign invaders. The
group had also the guidance and the stamina of fighters like the elderly Sihul as they
embarked upon bringing down a repressive system and aiming to progress and transform
Ethiopian society.
These young students had read passionately about the revolutionary armed
struggles in Algeria, China, Cuba, Guinea-Bissau and Vietnam, with the intention of
applying principles learnt there to removing the reactionary regime at home. In their
search for military knowledge, they became familiar with the war theories and tactics of
Sun Tzu, Carl von Clausewitz and Mao Tse-tung, to mention but a few. Closer to home
as well, there were lessons to learn from. Emperor Yohannes’s victories over invading
Egyptians at Gundet in 1875 and at Gurae in 1876, ras Alula’s victory over the Italian
colonial troops at Dogali in 1887, the defeat of the huge modern Italian army at the hands
of Emperor Menelik II at Adwa in 1896, the anti-fascist guerrilla movements (1936-41)
led by patriots like Dejazmach Gebre-Hiwet Meshesha, and the Woyyane of 1942-43, an
uprising of Tigraians for an autonomous administration led by reformers like Blata
Hailemariam Redda, were some of the experiences ingrained in their minds. This added
up to the perception of a glorious history of their region that invoked the spirit of
resistance against a regime that they believed was the source of their misery, and helped
mobilize the people to fight for a better future.
The rugged topography of Tigrai presented an immeasurable advantage to the
TPLF. Tigrai and the entire northern part of Ethiopia offer an ideal terrain for guerrilla
warfare. Egyptian warriors, Italian superior military organization with fighter planes,
tanks and heavy artillery had already been proven indecisive on several occasions against
ill-equipped and scattered Ethiopian patriots (rebels or shiftas) in this mountainous
terrain. In fact, this was why, on a number of occasions, shiftas (social bandits) had found
166it expedient to rise up against the state as rebels and had even managed to seize power –
as in the cases of Emperors Tewodros and Yohannes. This in a way also explains why the
TPLF were confidently able to engage in an armed struggle against the state, despite their
modest start with only a few rifles.
The TPLF pioneers had been closely following developments of the armed
struggle in neighbouring Eritrea. ‘If the Eritreans could rebel, why not we who are
neglected the most!’ was a repeatedly reiterated rationale of Tigraian youth at the time
the Eritreans were intensifying their struggle. They established connections with their
Eritrean counterparts when possible. Some Tigraian students and farm labourers in
Eritrea even joined the Eritrean fronts just to fight the common oppressor. Many of the
Eritrean fighters had been at school and at the university with the TPLF pioneers, and had
maintained contact even when the former became engaged in the armed struggle. These
relationships definitely paved the way towards initial cooperation. With friendly fronts
fighting the same government forces at their side, the TPLF fighters had no fear of enemy
encirclement and military debacle, as was the case with many young rebel movements
elsewhere.
Let us now look specifically at the growth of the TPLF fighting force in its
confrontations with the Dergue. The TPLF forces were made up of regular fighters
(hailitat), guerrilla units (kirbit), and people’s militia (woyenti). Even though the small
contingent that sparked off the emergence of the TPLF on 18 February 1975 in Dedebit
was composed of only ten men with scant weaponry, news of their existence and the
inflated size of their strength spread all over Tigrai in no time. As it did so, young boys
and girls, but mainly students, started to come to the rural areas in search of this newly
founded front. A lucky few would find someone to guide them to Dedebit, but many
came into contact with one of the other fronts and had to stay there until they could find a
safe exit strategy. Once you joined a front, it was often difficult – and in some cases
impossible – to defect or run away, because you would be suspected of returning to the
enemy.
167In a matter of three to four months, the small band more than tripled in size and
everyone was engaged in rigorous military training in the jungle of Dedebit. Asgede
Gebreselassie, a retired corporal in the previous government army, was the group’s first
trainer. He was supported by Sihul on practical issues and by the students concerning
theoretical matters. Everybody contributed something, depending on past experience, and
this made the training lively and productive. By the end of May 1975, the group that had
been sent to the EPLF base area for training had returned, armed with two AK47s, one
Simonov, one Uzi, three hand grenades and eight old rifles, supplied by the EPLF. As we
saw in Chapter 3, this arms supply was nominal and frustrated the group, whose
expectations had been very high. It sent out a message that the EPLF was not serious in
the progress of the Tigraian struggle, and almost everybody in the TPLF was offended by
the token arms offered by the EPLF. The idea of obtaining arms from the enemy began to
take root about this time. The EPLF-trained group joined the Dedebit contingent at
Hirmi, a few hours’ walk from Shire-Enda Selassie. It was one of the first positive
moments for both groups who were often far apart at critical times in the struggle. They
had the support of the nearby villages for food and drink as well as security, As Sihul had
popular support in this area, fear of enemy intrusion could be checked by the community,
keen to report any possible threat. Soon afterwards, four squads with about 10 fighters64
in each were created. While Sihul assumed overall leadership, Mussie and Aregawi were
made the squads’ commander and commissar respectively. The other leaders, Zeru,
Giday, Asfaha, Seyoum, Abbay and Hailu assumed squad leadership or departmental
posts. The whole contingent had to move again to Dedebit for comprehensive training
and consolidation of the new squad formations. With the flow of new recruits to the
Front, the number of fighters in each squad was growing steadily and new recruits were
forced to pass through military training while assigned to one of the squads. With the
rainy season beginning to make the ground muddy and everything becoming wet, life for
the whole new fighting force – whose roof was only the sky – was not easy.
64 The number of fighters in each squad often varied, as some were dropping out because of
fatigue, sickness, or being wounded or killed in a battle and/or with new fighters joining.
168In early August the same year, as we discussed in Chapter 2, two incidents
occurring inside the young organization – the capture of its military commander, Mussie
by the enemy, and another leader, Sihul, being swept away in a flash flood, although he
survived it – shocked every member. But for a front that was just starting out their rescue
was seen as an ominous success story and a blessing in disguise. Not only was the novice
army of the TPLF elated but everyone in the district was talking about them and their
actions. The news of their operations reached the whole of Tigrai, and from then on,
TPLF squads began to enter villages and hold public meetings. As the squads passed
villages, people cheered them and provided food and drink, while the younger boys
begged to join the Front. The fact that they had committed twelve fighters to rescue just
one comrade demonstrated the extent to which the Front was concerned about its
members and how strong comradeship amongst the fighters was. Thus, a heroic
precedence that was to reverberate for years to come was set just six months after the
TPLF’s inception. The leadership gained the confidence to initiate another strike and
planned an operation that would satisfy its need for arms and financial resources.
With the successful operation at Aksum a month later, the TPLF gained not only
badly needed arms and money but also wider publicity. All anti-Dergue elements and
particularly Tigraians were filled with hope. The older ones wanted to be connected with
the TPLF so that they could offer material help or advice and the younger ones wanted to
join the Front and fight.. Initiated by the two military victories a month apart, thousands
of the young generation were waiting to take up the challenge. It was this pressure of
youngsters wanting to join the Front at that early stage of the struggle that prompted the
TPLF to establish public-relations units that could control the flow of new recruits, and
instead organize and advise them to stay and work for the Front where they lived, until
such time that the Front was able to accommodate them. Yet many of them were pushing
to get to the Front by presenting reasons such as if they were to return to their homes they
would fall into the hands of government cadres and might be executed. Almost all these
young Tigraians were facing this dilemma. But because the Front was simply not able to
169accommodate them, many were forced to stay in villages as daily labourers rather than
return to their towns that were under the control of the Dergue.
Within a few months of the TPLF’s formation, the number of combatants in each
squad (mesree) had grown so rapidly that the squads had to take up the formation of
platoons (ganta), with three squads under each platoon. By October 1975, there were
three platoons each comprising 30-35 combatants. In February 1976, on its first
anniversary, all TPLF combatants gathered at Deima for the celebrations and participated
in the regular fighters’ (tegadelti) congress that elected a leadership for the first time. The
total number had risen to 126 combatants in the first year of the guerrilla movement. It
was at this time the platoon changed to company (haili) formation and from then on, the
company formation multiplied. Initially two companies called Haili Dedebit and Haili
Woyyane were created. Within three months, additional new hailis were being formed by
mixing the experienced combatants with the new arrivals. This system of putting older
and fresh combatants into new companies called Mitehnifats became regular practice as
new recruits were arriving regularly. By July 1976, the number of companies had risen to
nine and each company was made up of no fewer than 100 combatants. Each company
was identified by a numbered code-name as follows: 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81 and
91. A different series of numbers was given to departments that were primarily
supporting units of the fighting forces at the time. 00 was radio intelligence, 01 the
cultural unit, 02 training, 03 the health department, 04 propaganda, 05 economy, 06
security, 07 public relations, 08 administration and 09 army logistics. Later on, when
departments like general logistics, education and agriculture were created, they were
given the new codes 011, 012 and 013 respectively.
The companies were engaged purely in guerrilla activities like hit-and-run,
ambushes and surprise attacks on small isolated enemy posts where they were sure of
victory. They were scattered throughout almost every district in Tigrai, with high
mobility that made them appear greater in number than they actually were. They moved
at night to gain maximum surprise. Such engagement helped the TPLF to minimize
casualties and embolden the fighting sprit of its combatants. But it did not mean all
170engagements were free of setbacks. The incident at Amentila, a few hours’ walk to the
southeast of Meqele, was one setback when, on 18 November 1976, a platoon of
company 71 was forced by enemy surprise attack to retreat at night over unfamiliar
rugged terrain and most of its members plunged into the rocky ground from a cliff of over
ten meters high. In this disorderly retreat, a few died, many were injured and the whole
company had to leave the region until it could reorganize and make a comeback. This
was a minor incident compared to what was going to happen in March 1977 in western
Tigrai, the TPLF’s main base, when the major battles with the EDU emerged (See
Chapter 4). However, the real war with the Dergue army still had not occurred in this
period of TPLF organizational build-up.
In order to prepare for the long war with the Dergue army, the TPLF took to
seriously organize its own training, stimulated by the continuous swelling of the number
of recruits. Once base areas were established in the late 1970s, all TPLF forces passed
through rigorous three-month military training programmes, although crash courses had
to be given at times when the military campaigns (zemechas) by the Dergue were in full
swing. Basic military training was compulsory for all TPLF recruits and was given at the
department of training (taelim) code-name 02. Refresher courses called Mitnekar were
also arranged to fill gaps that transpired, especially after 1980 when the flow of peasant
recruits began to outnumber those of the urbanized students. Peasants needed more time
to grasp the skills and tactics required in war than the students whose numbers were
dwarfed by increasingly large groups of peasant recruits. With the growth of the army
and the formation of larger units such as brigades, support detachments and able military
commanders were needed at all levels. Immediately after the first organizational congress
in 1979, the Hakfen Military School was opened at a place called Bakla in Tembien to
give advanced training for middle and higher-level commanders. Although a few of the
instructors, like Halefom and Hadgu, had formal military training in Harar military
academy and other government military schools most of the instructors were self-
proclaimed tutors. The Hakfen School developed manuals for different aspects of
command by incorporating local experience with manuals from the Vietnamese, Chinese
171and other liberation movements who were engaged in armed struggle. Government army
manuals, which were found in garrisons the TPLF had overrun or were brought with
defecting officers, were extremely valuable in understanding the nature of the army and
developing comprehensive tactical manuals to counter it.
At this time, the TPLF seemed to have all the basic essentials that were necessary
to engage in the war against the Dergue. It had popular support in every aspect, the size
of the fighting force was growing steadily, and there was determined and capable
leadership at all levels. Perhaps the Front’s only visible limitation at this point was the
quality of its arms and the quantity of ammunition it had at its disposal, but every fighter
was instructed from the start that the main source of arms was the enemy and they had to
collect what they could from them. In one of the popular TPLF songs, Bahhrina (Our
Sea), the idea of arming from the enemy is engrained as a venerable verse.
Bahhrina ti hafash hizbina
Eerdina gobotat Aadina
Et’kina kabtom tselaetena …
Our sea is our people
Our trench is every mountain of our land
Our source of arms is the enemy …
With preparation for the final war accomplished and the Dergue’s violent actions towards
the people via air raids and ground attacks becoming more alarming, the TPLF was
preparing to take on the Dergue on any front, even in a conventional manner. The
TPLF’s prevalence over its former adversaries (the EDU, EPRP and ELF, see the
previous chapter) emboldened its determination to mete out a similar fate to the Dergue.
Let us now turn to how the confrontation with the Dergue on the battleground evolved
over the years.
172The Military Campaigns (Zemecha)65 of the Dergue
When the Dergue assumed power in 1974, it promised it would tackle Ethiopia’s
problems in a strictly peaceful way and coined the song Yale minim dem, Ethiopia
Tikdem (Without Bloodshed, Ethiopia Shall Move Forward), which was exceptionally
popular in the first few months. Initially, ‘Ethiopia Tikdem’ as a motto was acceptable to
the general public and seemed to address the latent but daunting problems of the
suppressed and ignored nationalities. Among the problematic social issues were the
longstanding economic question, evoking the slogan ‘land to the tiller’, and the question
of self-determination. The ‘Ethiopia Tikdem’ slogan was so general that nobody except
the Dergue perhaps, knew what the motto meant in practical terms. Nobody understood
how it would be applied to mitigate the deeply rooted and sensitive problems in the
multi-ethnic polity of Ethiopia. The land-reform proclamation had solely generated
support for the Dergue in the south, but that support soon evaporated with the
introduction of collectivization and forced recruitment to the army. Whatever the overall
intentions of the Dergue might have been, it took no time to resort to heavy-handed force
to silence any kind of dissent, independent thinking or legitimate demands such as
freedom of expression and regional autonomy or self-determination. Emerging national
movements for self-determination were the prime targets of their assault. All were
equated with the Eritrean secessionist movement, even though the latter had offered ‘…a
peaceful political resolution that could result in independence, federation or regional
autonomy through internationally supervised referendum’ (EPLF 1981: 109). Such
movements in the eyes of the Dergue were a thorn in the flesh of the ‘Ethiopia Tikdem’
dictum, and with the same tone such opponents or even those with much less strident
demands – like the TPLF – were warned that they should submit or would perish. As
Halliday and Molyneux (1981: 160) noted: ‘… the way in which Aman Andom, the first
65 For additional assessment of the Dergue’s military campaigns, see TPLF, ‘Temekiro
Zemechatatna’ (in Tigrigna), Tiri 1974 E.C.
173Dergue Chairman, was accused in November 1974 of having shown weakness in his
negotiation with the Eritrean guerrillas’ was to be seen in the light of the Dergue’s
dogmatic approach to the ‘Ethiopia Tikdem’ slogan.
Just a year after it seized power, the Dergue started preparation for a military
campaign, commonly known as zemecha. Part of the preparation was beating the drum of
war accompanied by terrorizing slogans like ‘Ethiopia will move forward, its oppressor
shall perish’ (Ethiopia tikdem aqourquazhwa yewdem), ‘If you do not surrender, you
shall be destroyed’, and ‘Shower bullets on the renegade’. On the other hand, the TPLF
was posturing ‘never to budge’, regardless of what might happen. This was reflected in
its own slogans: ‘kalsina newihin merirn, awetna nai-giden iyu’ (our struggle is long and
bitter but our victory is certain). A major war was inevitable.
Subsequently, the TPLF had to face eight major military campaigns (zemecha) in
the ten years between 1975 and 1985. Below, the nature and execution of these zemecha
are discussed, as are the responses of and impact on the growth of the TPLF.
Raza Zemecha, May-June 1976
The Dergue’s first military offensive was known as Raza Zemecha. The name Raza came
from the big bird of the same name that could fly through swarms of locust and ingest
them. Raza Zemecha was hastily organized and purely adventurous. The Dergue forced
thousands of peasants from southern Tigrai, Wollo, Gojjam, Gondar and northern Showa
to march through northern Tigrai (the TPLF’s initial mainstay) and end up in Eritrea,
where the main rebel forces (wombedé - bandits - as the Dergue called them) were found.
The majority of the peasants were rounded up in their own homes or farms or at market
places, and had no idea where they were going.
This massive peasant army, which stretched out for over 100 km in a mountainous
area from Adwa to Adigrat, had neither adequate training nor sufficient arms to engage in
battles with the guerrilla fighters, who had mastered the terrain and had the training and
motivation to fight. They had no rations but were allowed to appropriate any war bounty
174they could find. Swayed by Dergue agitators, many of the peasants had in fact joined the
Raza march with only spears and whips to beat the bandits and force them to submit.
According to Dawit Wolde-Giorgis (1989: 88-89) who was a major and in the Dergue
leadership at the time,
It was Mengistu’s idea, supported by Atnafu. They were dreaming of the past
when emperors such as Menelik had called on the Ethiopian warriors to
attack in semi-organized hordes, relying on their courage to win the day.
Unfortunately this was 1976, and the enemy was not armed with spears.
More than 100,000 peasants were given ancient Portuguese and Czech rifles,
some of them 50 years old. They were given no logistical support: virtually
no ammunition, no rations …. The march was doomed from the start. First,
because it was a march against our own people.
The aim of the Raza Zemecha, according to the Dergue, was to nip the TPLF in the bud,
advance to Eritrea and annihilate the ELF and EPLF. The TPLF was a young
organization at the time but its fighting force, though small in number, was motivated and
experienced enough to counter any attacking force by using guerrilla tactics. Looking to
the hastily planned and clumsy organization of the Raza Zemecha, however, it appeared
that the Dergue was ignorant of the rebels’ resolution and tenacity.
Realizing the poor quality of the army and the organizational weaknesses of the
Raza Zemecha, the TPLF took swift measures to disrupt the campaign before it began in
earnest in a planned setting. Agitation units were deployed in towns and villages on the
route of the ill-informed peasant soldiers to make them aware of the dangers awaiting
them and inform them of the Dergue’s duplicity. The aim was to disperse this hastily
mobilized peasant army before it engaged in pitched battles with the small but well-
trained guerrilla fighters. By sending out skirmishers to disorient the two vanguard units
heading from Adwa to Mereb and from Adigrat to Zalambesa (both bordering Eritrea),
the TPLF accomplished the bigger task in foiling the zemecha. There were some ELF
175surveillance units following the advance of the march. Soon, the whole campaign began
to fall apart, even before the main body of the peasant army had taken up its intended
strategic position to strike, let alone having reached Eritrea. The peasant troops ran away
from the battlefront in droves, and people in nearby villages cooperated by assisting them
in their withdrawal. By the end of May 1976, the bulk of the peasant troops were
dispersed and heading back to their respective villages in a disorderly manner. ‘The
operation, code-named ‘Raza’, ended in total humiliation…. Over 25,000 peasants
perished in this fiasco …’ (ibid.). The Raza Zemecha had a hugely demoralizing effect in
the Dergue camp, while it boosted the morale of the Fronts and the people who supported
them. For the TPLF, in particular, it was the first victorious counter-offensive that
injected a lot of spirit into its fighting forces.
The Jibo Zemecha – June 1976
A month after its failed Raza Zemecha, the Dergue organized its Jibo Zemecha, which
means ‘to devour like a hyena’. The Zemecha was spearheaded by a regiment of well-
trained counter-guerrilla forces known as Nebelbal but, like the Raza, the accompanying
body of the Nebelbal was the untrained mobilized peasant army. The Jibo was also
doomed to failure when its vanguard, Nebelbal, was wiped out at a place called Siero,
between Adwa and Adigrat, by the joint forces of the TPLF and EPLF.
The Semien or Red Star Zemecha – June 1978
This Zemecha, which directly followed the Ethiopian-Somali war of 1977-78, was quite
different from the previous two campaigns in terms of both quality and quantity. It was
massive in human and material resources and it had taken two years to mobilize, organize
and train over a quarter of a million peasants. ‘The limit was 300,000 both for eastern and
northern war fronts’ (Dawit Shifaw 2005: 101). The Soviet Union not only supplied all
the necessary weapons, ranging from MiG fighter planes to tanks and heavy artillery but
176also assisted in training and planning the war strategy. ‘The Soviet Army general V.I.
Petrov went to Ethiopia in November 1977 to work on the plan for the counter offensive
against Somalia (…) later visited Northern Ethiopia, now Eritrea’ (ibid.: 108). ‘Overall,
the USSR ferried over $1 billion worth of armaments… ; dispatched about 12,000 Cuban
combat troops, 1,500 Soviet military advisors, 750 soldiers from South Yemen and
‘several hundred’ East German technicians; and sent four Soviet generals’ (Patman 1990:
223). By all accounts, the largest army in Africa was created in famine-stricken Ethiopia.
By then, the Dergue had joined the Communist bloc and managed to secure the full
support of their military resources and expertise.
With a section of this huge army deployed to the Eastern Front earlier in March
1978, the Dergue had decisively defeated the invading Somali forces in the Ogaden. This
victory in the eastern part of Ethiopia helped to galvanize its army to try and attain a
similar victory in the north. In fact, the slogan of the day was ‘The triumph won in the
East shall be repeated in the North’ (be Misraq yetegegnew dil be Semien yedegemal)
followed by: ‘Mop up Tigrai and annihilate Eritrea’ (Tigraien massees, Eritrean
medemssees). As Dawit put it (1989: 109), 200,000 heavily armed troops were deployed
to the north. The morale of the army at its peak, it looked as if the end was approaching
for the Tigraian and Eritrean fronts in the north. But conditions there were not as they
appeared in the east. The war strategy of the fronts in the north was unconventional,
which gave them ample flexibility to deal with their militarily stronger opponent. In the
east, it was an invasion of Ethiopian territory by the Somali regular army supported by
local rebels, while in the north it was a liberation movement supported by larger segment
of the masses.
Assessing the magnitude of the military campaign, the northern fronts were
prepared to avoid frontal confrontation and adopt classical guerrilla warfare to foil the
third massive Zemecha, but not without putting their strength and morale to the test. The
Dergue deployed its forces on several fronts, including Adigrat, Enticho, Adwa, and
Shire as the main attack fronts. The TPLF made attempts to stop the Dergue’s advancing
forces on the Enticho front in collaboration with EPLF units at Gerhu-Sernay and on the
177Shire front with ELF units at Zagir, but to no avail. Facing little resistance, the forces of
the Dergue, in large task-force formation, swiftly rolled on deep into Eritrea. The ELF
dispersed its forces into the lowlands of Barka while the EPLF retreated to its base area in
the hills of Sahil, in the northern tip of Eritrea and dug trenches around the strategic town
of Nakfa. The TPLF, on the other hand, deployed its units to the rear of the advancing
enemy and began disrupting its supply lines and at the same time avoided frontal
confrontation with an army whose infliction of loss would have been severely damaging.
The TPLF, for the first time, faced a large conventional army and experienced
how to confront it. Without any meaningful losses in a frontal confrontation, the TPLF
resumed its guerrilla activities at will behind enemy lines. The heavy burden rested on the
EPLF, which was preparing to confront the enemy in static warfare in the trenches of
Nakfa. This strategy would later become one of the sources of difference with the TPLF
that led to the break-up of their cooperation. At this time, there were nearly 3,000 TPLF
recruits finishing their military training with the EPLF in Sahil. The EPLF requested
these fresh fighters be deployed as support troops in their defence line at Sahil. The TPLF
conceded this for a short period, until the dust of the zemecha settled. The concession of
the TPLF was not without valid reason. At that time, the TPLF wanted all the 13 plus
divisions of the Dergue to be engaged in that corner of Sahil until such time as it had
reorganized and trained its forces to meet the challenge of the day. Deployment of just
two or three of the Dergue’s divisions to Tigrai from Sahil could cause great havoc for
the TPLF, whose total force was then still not more than 1,000 fighters, i.e. 8 companies
(haili). This deployment was purely based on the military logic of the day in the interest
of the TPLF, and obviously it helped the EPLF to foil the Dergue’s zemecha. It was not
the pressure of the EPLF that forced the TPLF to involve its fighters in the Sahil
encounter, as some critics of the TPLF love to portray it. Nonetheless, the TPLF made it
clear to the EPLF that static warfare against an opponent with far greater human and
material resources was strategically ill-fated and that it would withdraw its forces any
time soon.
178However successful it appeared, the third Zemecha never led to mopping up the
TPLF in Tigrai, and it remained stuck beneath the hills of Sahil facing the EPLF’s well-
dug defence lines. ‘The greatest of all achievements in the campaign against Eritrea was
the opening of the Addis Ababa-Asmara highway… but the attempt to recapture the main
stronghold of the EPLF, Nakfa, failed’ (Dawit Shifaw 2005: 120-121). The TPLF,
however, emerged from this zemecha with its forces intact and more experienced, and
having acquired new arms from retreating soldiers. The growing morale of its people in
general, and the youth in particular, emboldened it and drew more recruits to its army. A
few months later its forces had increased in size, and a new formation of battalions was
created. It subsequently extended its mobility to eastern and southern Tigrai by attacking
isolated enemy posts and lying ambush for military convoys on the highways. As TPLF
forces were gradually increasing in size and the formation of its army growing steadily,
the nature of warfare was also transforming from guerrilla to mobile warfare, involving
frontal and positional confrontation.
The Fourth Zemecha – March 1979
The failure of the Red Star campaign was a big blow to the entire military establishment.
In the wake of the campaign, Bealu Girma, the Deputy Minister of Information under the
Dergue regime, published a book, called Oromai (= Lost Case), which detailed the
collapse of the Red Star campaign and the ineptness of Lt.-Col. Mengistu as commander-
in-chief of the Ethiopian armed forces. Bealu Girma was later mysteriously killed for this
revealing work and Ethiopia lost one of its most famous novelists. From here onwards,
the Dergue was engaged in frantic military ventures to contain and crush a rapidly
growing TPLF. For this reason it organized a fourth zemecha, exclusively to deal with the
TPLF.
With the TPLF’s military exertions escalating in Tigrai to the extent that its highly
guarded supply lines were continuously disrupted and its garrisons threatened, the
Dergue swiftly pulled back one of its mechanized brigades from Eritrea and with its
179forces in Tigrai launched the Fourth Zemecha. The Dergue took this move while it was
still trying to penetrate the EPLF’s trenches in the rough hills of Sahil. This zemecha,
which did not have a coded-name like its predecessors, was launched in mid-March 1979.
The campaign focused on the western lowlands of Tigrai, where the TPLF had
established strong base areas and in which it kept its materials including eight transport
vehicles that it had recently captured from the Dergue. The mechanized brigade and its
Tigrai-based auxiliary forces were lured deep into the Adiabo lowlands where it was
possible to launch flank attacks. Unable to sustain the TPLF’s swift and unconventional
assault, Dergue forces retreated to the highlands and joined the militia brigades under
Major Tefera Woldetensai. His campaign was more of a show of force than combat,
although it inflicted vindictive measures on the people of central Tigrai. The troops under
the command of Major Teferra were well known for their indiscriminate killing of
civilians purporting to be disguised members of the ‘bandits’ (TPLF) and setting villages
on fire. Without waiting to face an organized counterattack from the TPLF, Dergue
forces hurriedly retreated to their garrison towns, Meqele and Adigrat, and the fourth
zemecha came to an end.
The Fifth Zemecha – February 1980
As the TPLF appeared to become invincible in the campaigns conducted by the regular
army and seeing its menacingly swelling forces, the Dergue started to forcefully involve
local Tigraian elements. This scheme was a sign of frustration rather than of any military
logic. First, it organized all defectors from various fronts, including the TPLF, the EDU
and the EPRP, and formed a contingent that was given the code-name Zendo (python).
The defectors were by no means supporters of the Dergue and most had abandoned the
fronts simply because they could not endure the hardships of guerrilla life. So basically,
they were inimical to the idea of returning to a situation that induced their defection in the
first place. In addition to this, all physically fit Tigraian civil servants were ordered to
participate in the Zemecha without even a day’s military training. The Dergue’s rationale
180behind this was to create a rift between the TPLF and its would-be Tigraian supporters.
The whole scheme was counterproductive for the Dergue because both the people and the
TPLF were aware of its duplicity, and the Front avoided direct confrontations with the
Dergue forces in the entire Zemecha.
The Dergue’s plan with this campaign was to clear southern and central Tigrai of
insurgents. Yet unable to sustain the unconventional attacks of the TPLF, the regular
army, the Zendo and the reluctant civil servants were mixed up as the battle started in an
effort to avoid direct confrontation with TPLF fighters. Failing to coordinate the offence
and eventually their defensive tactics too, they ran in disarray to the garrison town of
Enticho, where the Fifth Zemecha came to an end in a matter of three days. Its abrupt
failure sent out a loud message that the TPLF, now organized in battalion formation, was
growing stronger and could not be defeated with such hastily mobilized forces and faulty
tactics.
The Sixth Zemecha – August 1980
The Dergue seemed to have realized its weakness from its failed campaigns. For the next
campaign, it trained a counterinsurgency force code-named Terara (Mountain), which
could penetrate any mountainous region where guerrillas could be found. It was armed
with modern light machine-guns, had long-range snipers and was ready to attack at any
time and at any place. It was also supported by MiGs and MI-24 helicopter gunships to
fight the insurgents at close range. Its accompanying political campaign was also quite
different from before. With recently trained cadres embedded in the army, it heralded the
approach of a people’s army and was quite different from its predecessors. Cadres of the
recently established Commission to Organize Party of the Workers of Ethiopia (COPWE)
were preaching ‘lasting peace’, ‘good governance’ and ‘all-round development’ for the
people. They told the population that mistakes had been committed by blaming innocent
people for the criminality of the wonbedé (bandits) and from here on that they were only
after the bandits of the TPLF.
181Indeed, Terara began advancing across the rough terrains of Tembien in central
Tigrai and along the Worie River. Initially, it looked militarily superior in tactics and
penetrated as far as the Worie gorges, one of the TPLF base areas. The TPLF, however,
adopted mobile war tactics with small units on the terrain where the enemy could not get
effective air support, and launched several attacks. It also began attacking the enemy’s
rear, blocking its supply line as well as destroying isolated posts in the adjacent provinces
of Wollo and Gondar. In this way, the TPLF’s theatre of operation was broadening as the
Dergue attempted the campaign. This strategy forced the Dergue to retract its counter-
insurgency Terara to the big towns, which had become increasingly vulnerable to TPLF
raids.
The Sixth Zemecha came to an end with yet another debacle of the Dergue forces
and meant a morale boost for the TPLF. Getting used to zemecha, all the departments of
the TPLF were now capable of operating as planned, and the training section was
producing new fighters that increased the size of the battalions, which in turn gave way to
the formation of brigades. Socio-economic activities among the people were also moving
in the intended direction, despite short-lived disruptions caused by the campaigns. ‘From
this campaign, the TPLF not only confirmed that its forces could not be wiped out as the
Dergue planned it but also gained the experience to carry on its program of tackling
socio-economic problems of its people uninterrupted even while Dergue’s zemecha was
in full swing’ (TPLF 1981: 55).
The Seventh and Eighth Zemecha – 1983 and 1984
These two zemecha were carried out at a time when the morale of the Dergue was on the
decline and the fighting spirit of its army was plummeting while the TPLF was
emboldened by its successive victories.
The Seventh Zemecha was launched in mid-1983 and the Eighth Zemecha a year
later, but neither could withstand the counter-offensive of the TPLF army. In the summer
of 1983, a whole brigade under the Tigrai command, part of the Seventh Zemecha, was
182annihilated on the Kafta terrains, a rugged place between Gondar and Humera, and all its
armaments were either captured or destroyed. The Eighth Zemecha was also a desperate
attempt by the Dergue to penetrate the ‘liberated’ central and western areas, only to face
a humiliating defeat by a combined attack by the TPLF’s regular and militia forces. The
Eighth Zemecha was the last of its kind although there were desperate attempts by the
Dergue to reverse the growth and onslaught of the TPLF.
All the Dergue’s zemechas ended in military failure. But it also suffered
politically, which discredited its legitimacy and political hold on the country. Conversely,
the TPLF came out stronger, and from then onwards the balance of forces steadily tilted
in its favour as the Dergue forces had to retreat more and more.
Towards the end of 1984 and at the beginning of 1985, the TPLF was by-and-large
engaged in advanced mobile warfare and working on conventional warfare. Air raids
were the attacks its people suffered from most, but now it began training anti-aircraft
gunners with the heavy weapons captured from the Dergue. As it intensified its mobile
warfare, Dergue forces began taking defensive positions in garrison towns like Meqele,
Adigrat, Adwa, Shire and Maichew. The area between the towns was in the hands of the
TPLF and the Dergue’s contingents could only travel with caution with a part of the force
giving cover to the other. Rural Tigrai by-and-large was now under the control of the
TPLF, and many villages were administered by ‘elected people’s councils’ called baito
(for a detailed analysis see Chapter 10) The baitos operated under strict supervision of the
TPLF cadres.
Meqele, the capital of Tigrai, also felt the heat of the expanding movements of the
TPLF. At midnight on 7 February 1986, the main prison in the capital was attacked and
all the 1,300 political prisoners were freed. They were taken to the TPLF base area and
most joined the Front. It was a shock to the command regiment of the Dergue forces,
which the same day had dispatched a contingent to attack TPLF diversionary units in a
nearby village. Out of sheer frustration, the Dergue intensified its retaliatory measures
and continued its air bombardment of villages, towns and market places to terrorize the
people in the hope that they would withdraw their support for the TPLF. On 22 June
1831988, when it was a market day in Hawzien, a town in central Tigrai, MiGs and a
squadron of helicopter gunships carried out a massive bombing raid in which over 1,800
civilians were killed. Abi-Adi, Yechela, Sheraro and Chila towns and more villages were
attacked in a similar way, also on market days and/or when other large-scale gatherings
were taking place. The Hawzien massacre was conducted under the leadership of Legesse
Asfaw, the commander of the armed forces in Tigrai at the time. As Dawit Wolde-
Giorgis (1989: 300) put it, ‘He [Legesse] never tried to hide his dislike of the Eritreans
and Tigraians’. Such acts swelled people’s anger and hate of the regime, and by the same
token tightened their support of the TPLF, the only alternative. Many elderly parents who
had been reluctant to let their children join the Front were now not only encouraging
them but also themselves requesting to be armed and join the militia forces. While the
numbers of TPLF brigades grew to more than 20,000 fighters, the Dergue’s forces were
dwindling. An August 1988 report by the TPLF’s military intelligence showed this,
pointing out how between 1979 and 1980 the Dergue had had 300,000 troops but by 1988
the number had dropped considerably (see Table 4.1).
Command centre Divisions No. of Troops
Eritrea (SRA) 11 71,500
Tigrai (TRA) 4 37,000
East 3 12,000
Centre 2 10,000
South 2 9,000
Total 22 139,500
Table 4.1 Distribution of Dergue Divisions in 1988
184According to the August 1988 TPLF report, the Dergue had lost a little over half its
army. At the end of 1988 an additional 108,000 recruits were trained that replenished the
army, increasing the number of its troops to 247,500 and the divisions to 25. This process
of filling the gaps created by previous losses would continue, but at the same time the
Ethiopian people were increasingly against it. Augmenting its troop numbers did not save
the Dergue from successive defeats at the hands of the still-growing TPLF.
Debate over Military Strategy
Bringing down the Dergue by any means was the TPLF’s unanimous objective, even
though there was serious difference as to how to go about achieving this goal. So far, the
military strategy of the TPLF had reflected the political objective highlighted in its
programme, namely the self-determination of Tigrai, and thus the war against the Dergue
had to be waged essentially by mobilizing the Tigraian population in Tigrai. Based on
this strategy, the war against the Ethiopian regime was confined to Tigrai, and the cost
was too heavy for Tigraians, with up to 10 small and large-scale military engagements
every month.66 However, considering the overall engagement with the Ethiopian military
forces, fighting and winning battles only in Tigrai could not bring the war to an end as
long as the Dergue prevailed in the greater part of Ethiopia – a very large rearguard
compared to that of the TPLF (see Figure 4.1 below). The Dergue had the advantage of
massive human and material resources under its control and continued to draw on these
vast resources of Ethiopia as a whole to feed and prolong the war. Consequently there
was a real need for the TPLF to carry on the struggle throughout Ethiopia to stop the flow
from the rearguard that was prolonging the war.
66 For instance, according to the official organ of the TPLF, Woyeen, August 1978, pp. 40-41,
there were 3 military engagements in the month of May 1978, 9 in June 1978 and 4 in July 1978.

This strategy required not only military vision but also the political will to work with
other Ethiopian organizations that could fight for collective interests, i.e. the removal of
the Dergue and the establishment of a democratic state. The TPLF was tied up in Tigrai
with its own political strategy of liberating Tigrai. This became an obstacle to its military
strategy of defeating the Dergue outright, which still had control of the greater part of
Ethiopia. This was a long-term dilemma that confronted policy makers in the TPLF’s
politburo. If its struggle was to achieve self-determination for Tigrai, then this could only
happen by replacing the Dergue with a democratic system that respected such a right.
The Dergue therefore had to be removed from the whole of the country, and a democratic
force had to take its place.
The TPLF’s politburo could not reach a consensus on this strategic matter that had
such widespread ramifications. Those who leant towards the separation of Tigrai (Sibhat,
Abbay, Seyoum and Meles) advocated an intensification of the struggle in Tigrai under
186the pretext of strengthening the rear. Others, like Aregawi, Giday, Teklu and Atsbaha,
pushed for broadening the struggle with participation of other Ethiopian forces. Some of
these fighters gave repeated recommendations to this effect in writing. In February 1983
(Lekatit 1975 E.C.), Aregawi Berhe, politburo member and head of the military
committee at the time, presented a paper to the politburo entitled ‘Concerning our
Military Strategy’ (Wetaderawi Stratejina Bezemelket). He showed the build-up of the
Dergue’s brigades from 36 brigades in 1977 to 135 brigades in 1982, of which 92 were
deployed in the north (Tigrai and Eritrea) and he declared that this trend would continue
as long as the Dergue had full control over 75-80% of the Ethiopian population. He
emphasized the need to create a united front among all democratic Ethiopian forces, not
just to help oust the military regime but also to build a better system that could
accommodate all the stakeholders. The politburo was reluctant to discuss the issue
seriously let alone to formulate a strategy to this effect. In 1984, he presented another
paper entitled ‘Protracted People’s War’ (Zetenawihe Hizbawi Kuinat) in which he
discussed the nature of the war the TPLF should wage and the need for alignment with all
democratic forces in Ethiopia focusing upon the rear and the front of its war vis-à-vis that
of the Dergue. This time a challenge emerged in a politburo meeting on the idea of
strengthening the TPLF’s rearguard, which would also mean limiting the mobility of the
Front and confining the struggle to Tigrai. But the point was that a strong rear feeds its
front and this could only be achieved by denying the rear at the disposal of the enemy.
Aregawi (1984: 52-53) argued, ‘The rear of the Woyyane (revolution) could be safe only
by disabling the rear of the enemy which is the source of energy for the front of the
latter’. The debate continued into the following year. For the third time, in April 1985
(Miyazia 1977 E.C.) and just a few months before the formation of the Marxist-Leninist
League of Tigray, see Chapter 7 below), another paper entitled ‘Integrated War in Tigrai’
(Kule-Medayawi Kuinat ab Tigrai) was presented to the politburo. This paper elaborated
on and summarized what had been proposed in the first two papers.
The Sibhat camp came up with a dubious response, arguing that they were forging
an all- Ethiopia struggle with such organizations as the EPDM (now ANDM), which in
187actual fact was a satellite organization. This response, although it looked like a solution,
was more of an escape mechanism and was concocted to avoid discussing the issue at the
upcoming TPLF/MLLT congress. By bringing the EPDM into the picture, they were
trying to suggest that cooperation with other Ethiopian organizations was in progress. Yet
the EPDM was a tiny satellite group of EPRP dissenters, organized and financed by the
TPLF to systematically project such an image and help keep at bay challenging
organizations elsewhere in Ethiopia. Two months later, after the third paper was
presented and in the wake of the MLLT formation in July 1985, Aregawi Berhe and
Giday Zeratsion, who challenged the politburo in the congress on ideological issues, were
removed from their positions as politburo members of the TPLF/MLLT. Charged with
concocted allegations, both were discharged from the Central Committee by the
politburo, even though they had been elected by the congress only a few days earlier. It
later transpired that this was a plan designed long before by Meles Zenawi and Sibhat
Nega, who managed to sway the rest of the politburo.67 The TPLF’s military strategy was
to remain in Tigrai, registering tactical gains until the entire force of the Dergue was
racked from within, opening the way for the TPLF to advance into the rest of Ethiopia.
Summary
Right from its inception, and evident from its slogans and eclectic ideology, it was not
difficult to perceive the totalitarian path the military Dergue was pursuing. The leftist
organizations like the TPLF, which emerged on the political landscape in the formative
years of the Dergue, considered the military regime as an illegitimate usurper of power
which would unleash all sorts of repressive measures to cling to power. Not only
67 Those politburo members were to become victims themselves of the same plotters years later.
In 2001, after disgreements over the 1998-2000 war with Eritrea, TPLF politburo members like
Gebru Asrat, Aregash Adane, Tewolde Woldemariam and Seye Abraha were removed from their
party positions and their parliamentary seats revoked, in breach of the constitutional rights of the
people which elected them.
188Dergue’s policies were unpopular, its methods of implementing them were also
excessively brutal, thereby pushed many people to the side of the opposition forces. In
fact, the proliferation of ethnic movements was clearly seen in conjunction with the rise
to power of the military Dergue.
As the Dergue was focusing on its military build-up as the main means of tackling
problems, meanwhile the TPLF too gave greater emphasis to the growth of its military
power in order to confront the growing threat of the Dergue. Using coercive methods of
recruitment and the massive military aid which it managed to receive from the then
USSR and the eastern bloc, the military regime at one point was able to command one of
the largest armies in sub-Saharan Africa. The TPLF on the other hand used mainly
persuasive methods to recruit fighters into its ranks, although coercion was also
employed intermittently, and more strongly as the years went by. With guerrilla warfare
as its paramount tactic, the TPLF managed to foil almost all military campaigns of the
Dergue, thereby gradually undermining the morale of the government troops.
Additionally, due to its own excesses, and also due to the propaganda work of the TPLF,
the government troops were alienated from the rural population. Despite such military
successes in Tigrai, the war seemed never to come to an end and the people of Tigrai
continued to incur heavy sacrifices. This was basically because of the political
leadership’s strategy of an ethno-nationalist sectarian agenda that confined the war within
Tigrai, while the enemy to be fought was controlling the vast and populous territory of
the rest of Ethiopia. With this strategy that invoked a lot of controversies and in-fighting
within the Front, the dominant section of the TPLF leadership was contemplating a
separate entity of Tigrai as a possible option of achieving self-determination. The fluidity
of ethnicity allowed for several options, depending on the political stance of its leaders,
and some dominant ethno-nationalists in the TPLF later took a different turn and devised
the formation of a coalition of other, like-minded forces to forge the Ethiopian Peoples
Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) in 1990 that proved to be an effective
stratagem to finally oust the Dergue and seize power. Ethnic mobilization in the
respective ethnic nationalities, indeed, created powerful forces that stood against the
189Dergue which separately they had found difficult to combat. It was the strategy of the
combined ethnic-regional forces under the EPRDF that brought down the military
government.
190Chapter 7
Ideological Controversies on Self-Determination
Introduction
There was and still is no international consensus on the scholarly and legal definition of
‘self-determination’, as discussed in the theoretical Chapter 2. This was true throughout
the struggle of the TPLF, even though self-determination itself was allegedly the cardinal
motivating issue of the struggle in the first place. Initially, as self-professed Marxists
whose theoretical models emphasised on class analysis, self-determination was
understood by the TPLF leaders as the right to express and determine the ‘collective
political will of an ethnically/linguistically defined group within the multi-ethnic society
of Ethiopia. What concrete political from this had to take was initially not clearly defined,
although it was expressed with vague references to democracy and people’s rights. In the
course of the struggle, however, the initial understanding of self-determination was
narrowed down, if not derailed, by a group within the leadership, which equated self-
determination for the various ‘nationalities’ of Ethiopia with secession. This group
reformulated the objectives of the TPLF into achieving a separate statehood. This was,
however, always controversial within the Front. Thus, after an internal theoretical and
political disagreement, the idea of secession was withdrawn in 1976, but not decisively,
as the nature of the issue itself – self-determination – was malleable. The fluidity of
ethnicity associated with the right to self-determination continued to be the tool of the
political elite to manoeuvre and reshape the perceptions of the people of Tigrai. This
chapter discusses the malleable nature of self-determination as the goal but also as a tool
of mobilization of ‘ethnic entrepreneurs’.
191The Early Phase of the Struggle
Almost all leaders of the TPLF thought of themselves as Marxist revolutionaries. Among
them, an informal group which later named itself the ‘communist core’ within the TPLF
was constituted by Abbay Tsehaye, Meles Zenawi and Sibhat Nega. It was this core
group that engineered the formation of the Marxist Leninist League of Tigrai (MLLT) in
July 1985, and became the leading ideologues on pertinent issues such as self-
determination.68 Yet the nature and intentions of this group were not fully known to many
until it seized power in Ethiopia in May 1991. It is, however, possible to explain its
salient political features and its organization from different perspectives. None of its
ideological characteristics are as revealing of its nature as its stance on the question of
self-determination for the people of Tigrai.
This matter is highlighted here for the following reasons: 1) since its articulation
by the Ethiopian students’ opposition political platform, the national question was
construed opportunistically and even distorted in many ways and yet has remained one of
the popular demands that has not found a proper resolution to date;69 2) in a more
political vein, unless clarity is achieved on this issue and its uses by political actors, the
prevailing confusion may unnecessarily drag the effort to find solutions to the question,
both in the particular Tigraian and the general Ethiopian context; 3) a proper analysis of
the problem will also cast some light on the behaviour of political groups such as the
MLLT/TPLF who seem to be bent on redefining popular demand and exploiting
68 The secession guise of self-determination brought this group together more than the principles
of communism and the party MLLT served as a pretext to get grip of the TPLF and work for the
implementation of their version of self-determination.
69 The powerful campaign and subsequently constitutional recognition of ethnic nationalities to
self-determination including and up to secession created the centrifugal tendency of even sub-
ethnic groups to claim this right, without giving due consideration to the adverse effect on the
centuries-old social fabric and the connected economies of the Ethiopian people which seem very
difficult to set apart. For a comprehensive understanding of this dilemma and the conflicts it has
generated, see Abbink (1998), ‘New configurations of Ethiopian ethnicity: the challenge of the
South’.
192grievances to promote a desire for power. It is likely that the entire ideological frame of
reference concerning ‘revolution’, ‘vanguard party’, ‘self-determination’, etc., inherited
from Marxist thinking, has to be fundamentally rethought and politically brought up-to-
date.
To understand the national question in Tigrai, ideologically appropriated by the
MLLT, it is necessary to start with the political programme of the movement that
coherently articulated it for the first time. This historic programme was drafted by the
Tigraian National Organization (TNO), better known as MAGEBT in Tigrigna, a
clandestine organization formed by progressive Tigraians in Addis Ababa in early 1974.70
It was stated in this document that ‘the people of Tigrai have suffered national
oppression’ and that ‘it is essential to create a nationalist organization in order to attain
freedom from national oppression and exploitation’.71 The programme, written in
Tigrigna, clearly maintained that the form of the struggle would be nationalist while its
content would remain class-based. The creation of a ‘united and democratic Ethiopia’
where the rights of all the ‘nations and nationalities’ to self-determination are respected
was the programme’s main goal.
The proclamation of a struggle for justice and equality for Tigrai within the
context of a united Ethiopia attracted many members of this region to the organization,
both from abroad and from within the country. This in turn led to the rapid growth of the
organization. MAGEBT issued and distributed propaganda material designed to elaborate
on its main themes at the end of 1974 and the beginning of 1975, when the programme
itself was not yet made public. Even though the right to secede as a democratic right was
entertained by the Left in general, it was not incorporated in these publications, but this is
not to say that there were no individuals reflecting what came to be called ‘narrow
nationalist sentiments’ within MAGEBT at the time. There were such members but owing
to the popular support that the aims of the movement outlined by the organization had
attained, they were not in a position to rewrite it according to their own wishes. As a
70 See Woyeen, August 1978, p. 11.
71 TNO (MAGEBT), 1974, unpublished document.
193result, the original programme, on the basis of which early political activity in the urban
areas was undertaken, continued to provide the guidelines for the armed struggle until it
was eventually replaced in 1976 by the so-called Manifesto 68 that advocated the
secession of Tigrai. In fact, the original programme not only attracted Tigraian
nationalists to the struggle but also laid the foundations upon which a class alliance with
multinational organizations could be built. The call extended to the EPRP to create a
united front is a case in point.
On the whole, there was a concerted effort at the time to coordinate the struggle
with other nationalist and multinational political forces in the country. The decision to
resolve the differences with the TLF and create a joint leadership was additional
testimony that the movement’s original aim was to establish a united country based on
the equality of all its nationalities. In other words, the decision that the organization made
to move its forces from Dedebit to Agame in the early phase of the struggle was aimed at
facilitating close collaboration with other political organizations such as the EPRP and
the TLF that were active in the area at that time. The aim was to create conducive
atmosphere for the formation of a united front to strengthen the common struggle.
Despite the TPLF’s initial attempts to win legitimate rights for Tigraians in a
democratic, united Ethiopia, the direction the movement took was subsequently altered to
accommodate the strategic inducements of the MLLT core. Why the changes that took
place later in the movement happened, what the internal and external factors were that led
to this, as well as the intricacies of the conflict related to this event, are issues that are
dealt with in the following section. The issues at hand illustrate the intricacies of ideology
within an emergent rebel movement that tried to fight for collective rights of a
constituency, but also to redefine a new social and political order in the process. This
phase of ‘ideological struggle’ on visions of the national future was closely tied up with
power struggles inside the movement and reflected the felt need for a strong political-
military ideology that could buttress the leadership of the movement. But it was
remarkable how these and subsequent discussions were conducted in the rather abstract
idiom and parameters of the Leftist student movement rather than being informed by a
194solid grass-roots appraisal of the needs, aims and expectations of the local (largely
peasant and non -literate) population.
The Manifesto 68: Secession as an End
The most conspicuous feature of the Manifesto 68 is its reformulation of the people of
Tigrai’s fight as a struggle to establish an ‘independent republic’. This objective of
creating a separate Tigraian state was in marked contrast to the movement’s original aim.
It is therefore necessary to ask why and how this new change took place.
As mentioned earlier, and as the elasticity of ethnic nationalism dictates, not all
members of the movement had been happy or fully convinced about the value of creating
a united country on the basis of equality, as was envisaged in the original programme.
Some members remained sceptical and were biding time to reverse this aim to replace it
with their own ideas. In fact, the authors72 of the new direction set out in the Manifesto
68 were none other than the individuals within the leadership who had been waiting for
an opportune moment to impose their wishes on the other members of the movement.
Rewriting the original programme in detail (but not altering it) was a previous decision
taken by the entire leadership, but which now became a pretext for derailing it.
The future leaders of the MLLT exploited the vanguard and paternalistic attitude
of the EPRP towards nationalist organizations as an excuse for pursuing a separatist
agenda. They wrote: ‘The chauvinist attitude of the EPRP is not only on the oppressed
nations in Ethiopia but it is also manifested by its policy on the Eritrean question’ (in
Woyeen, 1978: 23). Indeed, there were elements within the EPRP that showed contempt
for those who were not included in or led by their organization. Yet this was not in itself
72 It was not clear at the time who was organizing these like-minded ethno-nationalists, but later it
became obvious that Sibhat (Woldeselassie) Nega was the mentor behind inexperienced younger
members who pursued the secessionist line.
195sufficient to reverse the direction that the movement had originally approved as the right
path to attain the goal of unity with diversity and equality.
Before the actual reversal of the programme took place, intense discussions on the
‘hegemonic attitudes’ reflected by multinational organizations were held. On the basis of
these discussions, a consensus was reached that stated that it was difficult to create a
common front with organizations like the EPRP and still promote the common cause.
Despite this assertion, there was an understanding as to the need to create a united front
with other organizations deemed to be free of chauvinistic attitudes. Thus, even if the
perceived differences were stretched to mean that it was impossible to create a common
front with the EPRP, it could not have warranted the subsequent reversal of the original
programme undertaken by the MLLT leaders.
As we saw, Abbay Tsehaye, Meles Zenawi and Sibhat Nega were among the main
protagonists of the group that instigated the idea of secession. In June 1975 already,
Sibhat had gone as far as characterizing the Tigraian demand for self-determination in the
context of a ‘colonial question’, similar to that of the Eritreans.73 Together, they then
proceeded to draft the Manifesto 68, and gave it to Seyoum to print in the Sudan.
Seyoum,74 as a facilitator, printed a number of copies and sent them to Tigrai for
distribution. Before this however, there had been no one in the movement who called for
a revision of the original stand on the national question that opted for a realization of self-
determination within a democratic Ethiopia. The revision was not predicated on a
comprehensive study or a broad-based discussion within the organization itself. Neither
was it preceded by a collective decision by the members of the organization. So despite
its strategic importance, the idea of secession in the new manifesto and the changes
73 Sibhat brought up the idea of ‘colonized’ Tigrai in an informal discussion with Asfaha,
Aregawi and few others at Hirmi on their way to Kelakil in May 1975. Aregawi in particular
showed scepticism on the subjective proposal of Sibhat, and henceforth their relation remained
strained.
74 Seyoum retained a similar secessionist position, like the rest of the group. The present regional
map of Tigrai, with its new, clearly marked boundaries (see for instance the one at:
www.dppc.gov.et/downloadable/map/administrative/Atlas_Tigray.pdf), was also his making.
196accompanying this position were made without being deliberated upon in a CC meeting
or conference or presented to the general assembly for ratification.
It took a few months before the Manifesto reached the other members of the TPLF
leadership. On the other hand, its very distribution prompted criticism from various
organizations that accused the TPLF of issuing a ‘narrow nationalist’ and ‘separatist’
Manifesto. For their part, the other members of the TPLF leadership, who were not yet
aware of the publication of the Manifesto, construed the criticism as baseless charges by
adversaries.
When copies of the Manifesto 68 arrived from Sudan in July 1976, some of the
leadership (Mussie, Sibhat, Abbay and Aregawi) and a few other fighters were at
Tsorona. Anxiously, they all started to read it. Since its contents were clearly not in line
with the organization’s previous position, a heated discussion developed among the
leadership members present. For their part, however, the three individuals who wrote the
Manifesto argued that their proposal to establish an independent Tigrai was based on
earlier consensus within the movement regarding the impossibility of creating a united
front with the ‘chauvinist’ political organizations active at the time. The new position
was, in the end, seen as a mistake by the TPLF leading members, and agreement was
reached about maintaining the organization’s original point of view on the matter. In
other words, since the new formulation was thought to be wrong and was expected to
lead to political misunderstandings, historical contradictions and even internal conflict, an
immediate decision was reached to abandon it and resort to the movement’s original
position.
Faced with this scepticism, the authors of Manifesto 68 did not argue for their new
position strongly. In fact, they seemed to drop the secession standpoint without debating
the concomitant points thoroughly. In hindsight it would appear that the authors did not
believe in earlier class-based approaches to the national question. Since they could not
provide credible historical and theoretical arguments to back what they actually believed
in, they formally retracted their secessionist stand. Yet, they resorted to searching for an
excuse for having advanced it by pointing to the ‘chauvinistic attitude’ of the other
197Ethiopian insurgent organizations towards the TPLF, thereby informally justifying own
their call for secession. All this created a false impression within the organization that the
issue was resolved.
Despite its exclusivist or ‘narrow nationalist’ leanings, the communist core group
did not want to be singled out for criticism and be labelled as an anti-unity force
thwarting the collective and democratic aspirations of the Ethiopian people. Ironically,
the group went to great lengths to pose as a champion of the latter cause by advocating
measures to neutralize or liquidate organizations that had the same political stand on the
national question. A good case in point in this regard is the Tigray Liberation Front
(TLF), which like the originators of the Manifesto 68 maintained that the national
question of the Tigraian people was to yield a demand for independence. While these two
groups had the same goal of creating an independent state for Tigraians, the TPLF
Manifesto core (later to become MLLT) accused the TLF of ‘narrow nationalism’75, and
subsequently congratulated itself for following ‘the correct line’ on the national question
at the MLLT congress in 1985.76
As a matter of fact, the group retreated from publicly stating its secessionist
position because of EPLF’s pressure77 and EPRP’s repeated accusation in the form of a
campaign against the TPLF’s separatist project. Even though the criticisms of these two
organizations against the secessionist stance were made for different reasons, their impact
and the internal opposition to the revision of the programme forced the communist group
to withdraw it and desist from propagating it in public. But had it not been for the internal
and external factors, the communist group could have pushed the secessionist agenda to
its limits. There is indirect acknowledgement of this fact in the group’s own evaluation of
its ten-year activities:
75 An accusation heard until this day levelled by TPLF or government members at groups
advancing an ethnic autonomy or ethno-nationalist agenda.
76 See: ‘Evaluation of the Ten Years Journey of the Communist Core within the TPLF/ Adopted
in the Founding Congress of the MLLT’, July 1977 E.C.: 17
77 EPLF’s pressure was not induced out of a principle to see a united Ethiopia, but to avoid an
international censure that they were separatists fostering the breakup of Ethiopia.
198The main reason for the emergence of this narrow nationalist tendency was
the lack of clarity in the outlook of the communist force even though a
similar trend among the population and the chauvinistic attitude reflected
both by the government and multinational organizations had also contributed
towards its expression (MLLT 1985: 24-25).
This self-evaluation of the communist core was self-contradictory. On the one hand it
maintained that the political line it had followed was correct and that it had exposed the
narrow nationalism of the TLF (ibid.: 17, 27), while on the other hand, it suggested that
this same outlook lacked clarity and, as a result, the TPLF had made a mistake on the
national question. This apparent contradiction makes sense only if we disregard the self-
justification of the group and we stick to what actually happened during the early phase
of the struggle. The communist core attempted to replace the movement’s original
programme with its own secessionist stance and was forced to abandon it as a result of
internal and external pressures. Not only was the narrow nationalist standpoint
unacceptable to most of the militants and many Tigraians aware of the region’s history, it
also deprived the group itself of the progressive mask it wanted to wear in public.
Incidentally, the inclusion in the current, 1995 Ethiopian Constitution of the right to
secede for all the 89 ethnic groups of Ethiopia (Article 39.1) is a result of their approach
and proves the position they pursued for so long. But their progressive mask seems to
have confused a lot of people, including the researcher John Young, the author of
Peasant Revolution in Ethiopia: the TPLF, 1975-1991 (1997: 99). He emphatically
wrote: ‘Opponents of the TPLF charge that such statements demonstrate its goal is to
dismantle Ethiopia along ethnic lines. This is not the case’, and goes on: ‘Although the
Manifesto was produced by elements within the leadership, no names accompany the
document’. Firstly, it is unacceptable to expect or think of individual names when the
Manifesto came up bearing the name of the organization, the TPLF; besides, it was partly
the authors’ strategy to make it an as broadly accepted document as possible. Secondly, a
researcher who spent more than a year interviewing cadres and leaders of the TPLF,
199including Sibhat, Meles and Abbay, could have asked just one question to the top
members of the Front: ‘Who wrote the Manifesto?’ and discover the authors. By not
tackling this issue and not giving the attention it deserves, Young78 by implication makes
it clear that the men in power were responsible for the controversial stand in the
Manifesto that they perhaps had been trying to cover it up.
Organizational Policy and Plan of Action
Differences of ideology and political strategy within the TPLF leadership were played
down during most of the years of the struggle. This might have helped the members to
focus on just fighting the enemy (Dergue) but failed to realize the dangerous direction the
Front was leading them in. Differences manifested themselves in the course of
implementing political and military policies which were apparently agreed upon by all
the members of the leadership. Whenever such differences appeared among the rank and
file and seemed to provoke serious discussions, they were blocked by loyal cadres who
reiterate the leadership’s voice. The contestable acts responsible for the differences were
justified as being in the spirit of the TPLF’s first general assembly resolution. There were
virtually no opportunities to raise and discuss points of disagreement, as such points were
considered unimportant and subservient to the main goal of the struggle. If there were
debates, they were only among the top leaders of the CC or the politburo. In fact, using
this catch-all phrase, the MLLT leaders tried to cleverly construe their position as the
generally binding guideline of the organization at large.
As stated above, Manifesto 68 was subsequently dropped, not as a result of
debates and discussions among the rank and file members or cadres or even the congress
but because of differences within the politburo and external pressure. In 1979 the first
78 It is still unclear why Young had to avoid this important issue in the political history of the
TPLF and even in his subsequent articles on the Front. Young had solid and detailed information
about this fact from insiders like Kahsay Berhe, Giday Zeratsion, Aregawi Berhe, etc.
200TPLF Congress adopted a new programme, devised to correct the secessionist trend that
had started to creep into the organization. Yet it would not be far from the truth to say
that the TPLF did not explicitly attempt to struggle for a united and democratic Ethiopia
during the period between the organization’s first and second congresses. Contrary to its
publicly stated objective, anti-Amhara propaganda was subtly encouraged within the
movement. Cultural events, theatrical performances as well as jokes and derogatory
remarks were used to disseminate this poisonous attitude. Fuelling some historical
grudges perpetrated by the ruling classes, the Sibhat faction tried to cast doubt on the
possibility of living in unity with ‘the Amhara’. While they stressed how Emperor
Menelik’s army pillaged the property of Tigraian people during its Adwa campaign, the
damage the same forces had also incurred on the Amhara or Agew peasants was
intentionally ignored. These lopsided historical presentations were noted and criticized by
friendly organizations like the Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement (EPDM). This
does not mean, however, that all the cultural performances presented by the organization
were narrowly nationalist in nature. Performances reflecting the class solidarity of all
oppressed people were also enacted alongside the former. By condoning anti-Amhara
remarks and allowing hostile expressions against an entire group of people within an
organization supposedly struggling for a united country based on equality, the MLLT
leaders were sabotaging from within the very aim for which the movement was started in
the first place. Whenever they found events that served their purpose of fuelling conflict
among different nationalities, they magnified it and whenever they came across
conditions that pointed to the historical connections of the latter, they chose to ignore and
downplay them. Attempts to correct such misconceptions were also discouraged and
considered a ‘waste of time on marginal issues’.
From the beginning of the first TPLF congress in 1979 until the end of 1985, the
communist core, which later turned out to be the MLLT leadership, was also actively
resisting any attempt to reconcile the organization’s military operation with its political
aims. The corrective suggestions put forward at the time were mainly intended to enable
the military activities to reflect the broad objective of creating a united country. It was
201stressed that the military government was making use of the country’s total human and
material resources to suppress resistance in Ethiopia and Eritrea. The effort to put an end
to the power of the military regime thus required the anti-Dergue struggle to be waged
countrywide. Even though the TPLF was a nationalist movement and as an Ethiopian
organization was struggling to create a reformed, united country, it also reserved the right
to undertake its military and political activities in all parts of Ethiopia. It was on the basis
of this conviction that the TPLF undertook surprise operations in Wollo and Gondar
regions in the second half of the 1970s.
Despite efforts to give the struggle a countrywide dimension, the internal
intricacies to limit it within the confines of Tigrai became insurmountable over the course
of time. When villages like Fersmai and Edaga-Arbi fell to the Dergue forces in 1986, the
MLLT group would complain of not having defended these places, an argument ignoring
the fact that static warfare to defend a territory was not possible for the TPLF, which
could only conduct guerrilla or mobile warfare at the time. Due to the sectarian politico-
military strategy that isolated Tigrai from the rest of Ethiopia, the fighting tactics of
TPLF was affected, and many villages in Tigrai became targets of acts of reprisal by the
Dergue while other parts of Ethiopia enjoyed relative peace. In a way, this ideology of
exclusiveness as stipulated in the Manifesto and the confinement of the military activities
to Tigrai alone became more influential in the movement, but with adverse effects. If the
strategic goal of the organization was not the creation of an independent republic of
Tigrai, there were neither political nor military reasons why the rear and the frontline of
the struggle should be confined to Tigrai alone. By isolating the Front from other
Ethiopian forces and cutting the movement off from human and material resources it
could have mobilized in and from other parts of the country, the MLLT leadership
followed a strategy that probably prolonged the war unnecessarily, with devastating
consequences for the people it claimed to want to liberate. For the population of Tigrai,
the cost of fighting the Ethiopian military regime was high in every aspect.79 The
Manifesto thinking, indeed, was not dominant among the people and rank and file
79 For details see the military campaigns (zemechas) of the Dergue in Chapter 4.
202members, but it was the belief of the influential group in the leadership that had the
capacity to manipulate policies and strategies of the Front.
‘Narrow’ Nationalism after the Second TPLF Congress
When the time for a TPLF congress approached, the communist core posed as a guardian
of the Ethiopian revolution. That the Tigraian revolution was part and parcel of the
Ethiopian revolution and the strategic aim of the struggle was the victory of the Ethiopian
revolution were given prominence by them in slogans during the 1976 Fighters’ Congress
and the 1979 Organizational Congress. These themes were now accompanied by the call
to establish a ‘united’ or common front with other movements for their realization.
Activities undertaken in the name of Ethiopia were traced to the cooperation established
with the EPDM. Joint measures by the two organizations were exaggerated and praised at
every opportunity, as if the then powerless EPDM had an independent existence and
enjoyed parity of esteem.
The need to create a common front among the anti-Dergue opposition forces was
also stressed in the resolution of the second TPLF Congress in 1983. Yet, the same issue
was only casually raised in the meeting of the Central Committee, where plans of action
should have been discussed in detail. It was not even given the importance that it had
received during the general assembly, and the Central Committee did not come up with
specific guidelines for its implementation. On the other hand, the group led by Abbay
Tsehaye and Meles Zenawi argued against a detailed discussion of the issue, claiming
that there were no organizations that qualified for a united front at the time. In the
absence of such organizations, talk on how to implement the task would be out of place,
they argued. A few members among the leadership contested the views expressed by the
communist core and urged the Central Committee still to give the matter the attention and
weight it deserved. They maintained that every anti-Dergue organization opposed to the
intervention of the Soviet Union would be considered eligible to join the front and there
203were many of them. On the basis of this broad view, they recommended the drafting of a
detailed proposal with which to approach other organizations. It was also emphasized that
previous calls for a united front had failed because of a lack of concrete suggestions to
resolve political differences between potential members.
Eventually it was decided that a renewed call for a common front should be
forwarded and an agreement was reached to include the following points in the detailed
proposal:
(cid:190) The aim of the united front would be to remove the Dergue and Soviet
interventionism and establish a transitional government consisting of
representatives of the member organizations.
(cid:190) The transitional government would guarantee the full respect of democratic rights
and pave the way for the creation of a people’s democratic state.
(cid:190) The government would ensure the resolution of the demand for self-determination
through popular referendum.
(cid:190) Any organization engaged in a tangible anti-Dergue, anti-Soviet political struggle
was eligible for membership.
(cid:190) The proposal also required that all member organizations support the right of
nations to self-determination both in word and deed.
This last point raised debate on how to deal with organizations that partially concurred or
rejected out-rightly the right of self-determination and those that did not have a clear
position on the issue. Such general responses from different organizations were reported
at a politburo meeting during the second TPLF congress in Tekeze in 1983 by Berhane
Gebrekristos, who at the same time suggested that the call for a common front
‘…requires clarity’. A strong attack on Berhane’s suggestion80 came from Meles Zenawi
80 Berhane’s report and suggestion reflected the attitude of opposition organizations towards the
TPLF’s call of a united front, but it was belittled by Meles, who was backed up by Abbay.
Berhane was spared by other CC members, who argued that he ‘… reported the real viewpoint of
the opposition groups. Do you want him to report what was not there?’ Meles was then forced to
204and the issue of the call was left as it was and unresolved. The fact that important points
related to the formation of a united front were left open-ended presented ample
opportunities to the minority opposition, bent on advancing their group’s interests in
interpreting matters as they saw fit and delaying the formation of the common front.
Since the goal this group wanted to achieve was confined to the province of Tigrai, the
broader call for a united struggle with other Ethiopian organizations remained
unanswered for a long time (from the 1976 Fighters’ Congress to the 1983 Second
Organizational Congress). Despite the vague call for the united front, no concrete steps
were therefore taken. Instead of meeting the political organizations concerned face-to-
face and facilitating the creation of an alliance, the section of the CC assigned to
undertake this task became engaged in contacting foreign governments and parties to give
the impression to these forces that the call for a common front was not given positive
response by other organizations at home. Thus they shifted the space of activity for the
formation of the united front outside Ethiopia. In 1978 the opposition group in the TPLF
wrote:
There is no multi-national organization that could act as central force
around which a countrywide struggle is to be mobilized. Besides under the
existing conditions even an organization like EPDM which has a relatively
better organizational strength and ideological clarity cannot be said to have
reached a level of development that enables it to carry on this
responsibility.… given this objective condition, it is inevitable that the
Ethiopian revolution should be undertaken in a disorganised and
spontaneous manner and that this situation is not something that could be
changed within a short period of time. (TPLF, May Day, April 1978)
retract his allegation because at this stage of the struggle he had not established himself as a
dominant leader and could only push his ideas with different means, working behind the scene.
205Still, from the start of the TPLF, the need to eventually create a united front with other
opposition groups had been considered a precondition to expediting the fall of the Dergue
and to strengthen the struggle for political change in Ethiopia. This goal was not achieved
for a number of years because of the emerging separatist agenda of the above-mentioned
‘proto-MLLT’ group and its hostile and condescending attitude towards other
organizations, which understandably had alternative political programs. The proto-MLLT
group seemed not only belligerent towards such organizations, but was also reluctant to
coordinate the actual struggle on parity even with the only organization with which it
declared itself to have had a common strategic goal for years, the EPDM. Several
demands of the EPDM to independently operate in Tigrai were rebuffed, and individual
EPDM members like Yared Tibebu (Jebesa)81 who dared to make remarks critical of the
MLLT leaders’ handling of the relationship between the two organizations were
threatened and pressured to resign from their organization. Other fighter who were
opposed to the TPLF’s unilateralism and demanded a united form of struggle in parity
also met with a similar fate. In this manner, the central ideas of the right to self-
determination, democracy and ethno-regional autonomy, through which people of
different ethnic background or belief could become masters of their destiny and live more
harmoniously on the basis of equally recognized rights and obligations, has been derailed
due to the blemished interpretation and execution of the issue by the TPLF leaders.
Summary
The power, fluidity and unruliness of ethnicity are evident in political efforts to mobilize
constituencies and to ‘implement’ it as a political ideology. This is evident also in the
aspirations toward self-determination taken up by ethno-regional rebel movement such as
the TPLF. Right from the beginning of the struggle of the TPLF there was no unified
consensus on the nature and definition of self-determination among its political elite. This

206was rooted in different conceptions of the history and identity of the region of Tigrai, its
place in the wider Ethiopian state framework, and the intersection of ethnic mobilization
ideology with class analysis and strategy. To some, the self-determination of Tigrai
meant its full secession from Ethiopia and establishing an independent state; to others it
was only the attainment of equal though more autonomous status in the political and
socio-economic realm within the confines of a democratic Ethiopia. However, for most of
the time during the struggle, such differences were overshadowed by the intensity of the
ongoing guerrilla war itself. As a result, the implications and consequences of this crucial
question for a country which had existed for centuries as one political entity in spite of its
asymmetrical ethnic relationships, were overlooked.
When the ‘Manifesto 68’ group (the proto-MLLT group) that espoused formation
of a separate state as an objective of the struggle for self-determination included notions
of secession in an (unauthorized) published manifesto of the Front, an acrimonious
debate was triggered in the organization, finally ending in withdrawing, or at least
shelving, the secession idea. This did not mean though that a conclusive understanding of
what self-determination entails was agreed upon. The debate continued, taking different
twists and turns, as reflected in the policies and activities of the Front.
207Chapter 8
Capture of a Movement: the Role of the Marxist-Leninist League of Tigrai (MLLT)
Introduction
This chapter pursues in more detail the development of the TPLF during and after the
emergence of the MLLT, the ‘sub-movement’ within the Front that gained such a
prominent political and ideological role and put its stamp on post-1991 Ethiopia after the
TPLF gained state power.
Initially, the TPLF considered itself an organization within the broad spectrum of
Marxist movements of the Ethiopian left. With the rapidly growing number of peasant
and nationalist members in the Front in the late 1970s, the left-wing elements saw the
need to organize themselves to lead the Front in the direction they believed would realize
the interests of the ‘poor and exploited masses’, and in which the right to self-
determination of Tigraians would be respected. At the beginning of 1978, a Marxist-
Leninist group was uniting around this notion within the TPLF - as a network of
revolutionary fighters who believed in socialism as a just and fair system for all. Later on,
this group forged an association known as Merih Baeta (in Tigrigna: ‘leading elements’).
All the educated and experienced fighters with a leftist background were listed in the
Merih Baeta category, since it was assumed that they would all readily subscribe to the
National Democratic Revolution Program (NDR).82 This elite group constituted a small
part of the TPLF’s larger peasant army. In due course, the Merih Baeta developed into
the Marxist Leninist League of Tigrai (MLLT), the antecedents of which were described
in Chapter 7. At its formation, the MLLT was declared a party of the so-called
82 The National Democratic Revolution (NDR) and its variant the People’s Democratic
Revolution (PDR), core Marxist concepts, were thought to be the defining revolutionary moments
leading to a socialist revolution. This was also the Maoist recommendation for underdeveloped
countries.
208communists within the TPLF who were also the leading elements (Merih Baeta) in the
Front.
On 25 July 1985 the MLLT was formally set up in the liberated central region of
Tigrai, in the gorge of the River Worii, in the midst of a famine that took the lives of tens
of thousands of people in Tigrai’s densely populated highlands. The founding congress
convened for thirteen days and the party’s organizers (Abbay Tsehaye and Meles
Zenawi) argued for the urgent need to create the party at this time. They claimed their
intention was to provide ideological guidance and inject fresh political life into the ailing
TPLF which, they thought, had lost its sense of direction. Some TPLF members
wondered whether this was the real reason for the setting up of the MLLT or whether it
was a measure to oust prominent leaders who simply had different views and whose main
focus was the success of the struggle as opposed to power-mongering and ideological
refinement. Or perhaps elements of both drove them to create the MLLT at this difficult
time. From the start, the MLLT was, therefore, highly contested.
The founding congress of the MLLT declared that ‘…after over 10 years of
struggle and preparation, in an atmosphere of deep democratic spirit, a founding congress
that was convened in the liberated area of Tigrai from Hamle 5-18, 1977 EC (12-25 July
1985) formed the MLLT’. Although the MLLT’s first chairman was Abbay Tsehaye, the
chief ideologue and architect of the party was Meles Zenawi, the current Prime Minister
of Ethiopia and leader of the ruling TPLF/EPRDF.
As the MLLT captured the leadership of the TPLF in the 1980s and showed itself
to be highly influential also in the post-1991 period, we here discuss how the MLLT
emerged and managed to control the Front, how it guided the mobilized people of Tigrai,
and how it paved the way to seize power in Ethiopia. It provides an interesting though
ironic case of the definition and instrumental use of a mobilizing ideology to augment or
replace the earlier ethno-nationalist one. It is ironic because the new group emerged
appealing to a (universalist) Marxist-socialist ideology but at the same time claiming a
solution for Tigrai (i.e., toward ‘secession’) instead of for Ethiopia as a whole. We also
209look into the twists and turns the party leaders had to make to gain the West’s support
and still maintain their old ideology.
Leftist Orientation of the TPLF
The MLLT had its inspiration in the radical movements that engulfed the world in the
1960s and early 1970s, including in insurgent and liberation movements across Africa.
These tumultuous years were marked by student protest movements around the world
against the Vietnam War and by loud cries for socialism. The familiar phenomena of
‘imperialism’, ‘bureaucratic capitalism’ and ‘remnants of feudalism’ were believed to be
the enemies of the world’s working classes and the peasantry. The anti-colonial
movement throughout the Third World was treated as part and parcel of a bigger anti-
imperialist wave. Significant numbers of Ethiopian university students from this
generation considered themselves as part of the worldwide revolutionary movement and,
in many cases, acted not only as catalysts but also as dynamic members of the movement
(cf. Balsvik 1985; Fentahun 1990). The Ethiopian students’ movement influenced the
revolutionary course of events in the then predominantly feudalist and traditional society
of imperial Ethiopia.
Although the attempted coup d’état to depose Emperor Haile Selassie in 1960 was
crushed and its leaders put to death as a lesson to others, it was an inspiration to
Ethiopian students and galvanized their movement. Determination to abolish feudalism
and the grip of imperialism was growing rapidly while the need for radical change took
on a new ideological (Marxist) paradigm. This movement became the basis for the rise of
political parties of ethnic and multi-ethnic composition that hitherto had never been heard
of in Ethiopia. Radical students started to regroup and published illegal papers such as
Democracia, Abyot (Revolution) and Ye Sefiw-Hizb Deemts (Voice of the Masses). In
this process, the first multi-ethnic organizations, like the Ethiopian People’s
Revolutionary Party (EPRP) and the All-Ethiopia Socialist Movement, known in Ethiopia
210by its Amharic acronym ‘Meison’ which later became the mainstream leftist
organizations of the Ethiopian students’ movement and the educated classes, were in the
making (Andargachew Aseged 2000).
Overall unrest in the country, spearheaded by the students, gave rise to a
spontaneous revolution that broke out in February 1974 and swept the monarchy from its
hereditary throne. As there was no organized legal opposition that could have directed the
revolution through a transition process, the only organized and armed force – the military
– was at an advantage and manipulated the turn of events. The army officers who
organized themselves in a committee called the Provisional Military Administrative
Council (PMAC), commonly known as Dergue, took over state power on 12 September
1974. The Dergue swiftly responded to the long-standing call of the people, like ‘land to
the tiller’, and introduced a radical land-reform programme (1975) and also nationalized
all industries in the name of the people. The latter was a populist move and basically
ignored calls to hand power to the people and refused to allow independent political
parties and a free press to operate. In addition, it denied the people their human and
democratic rights to organize and express their views freely. Finally, it unleashed its ‘Red
Terror Campaign’ (1977-1978) aimed at violently suppressing opposition movements of
any form.
One of the failures of the Dergue was to overlook the younger generation
radicalized by student movements. To be a left-wing revolutionary and converse on
Marxist ideas was the norm in those days, especially for the young intellectuals and
students of the 1960s and 1970s. The youth was poised to challenge any power in
Ethiopia that did not conform to the perceived ‘aspirations of the people’ and the
revolutionary changes it cherished. Thus, the Dergue’s military dictatorship on the one
hand and the revolutionary zeal of Ethiopia’s younger generation on the other were
facing each other, with neither side showing any sign of retreating.
Although Tigraian students were small in number at Haile Selassie I University
and other colleges, their involvement in the revolutionary momentum was very
significant. Except for the elderly Sihul, who died a year after the start of the armed
211struggle in 1976, all who forged the TNO (forerunner of TPLF) were young university
students in their early twenties and offshoots of the radical Ethiopian students’ movement
from the 1960s and early 1970s. They espoused Marxism-Leninism as guiding ideology
to realize their dream of ending the backwardness and misery of the Ethiopian people and
bringing them the ‘light of progress’. Parallel to their academic studies, all of them were
engaged in reading, discussing and promoting Marxist theory. In fact, they paid more
attention to revolutionary ventures than to their academic studies. Many study cells were
formed to digest Marxism, and all their activities were fuelled by the desire to start a
revolution that would ‘remove Ethiopia from the yoke of feudalism and imperialism’.
Since they believed wholeheartedly in it as a guiding means of liberating the exploited
and neglected masses from their miserable lives, they challenged the autocratic
government of Haile Selassie, putting their own lives at risk. With stones and clubs
against tear gas and bullets, they fought the police and at times the army in the streets of
the major cities of Ethiopia. Many students were killed or injured in the struggles. The
cumulative efforts of these ‘vanguard’ Ethiopian students, together with groups from the
working class, the intelligentsia and the army, brought down the government of Haile
Selassie. As this revolution progressed without a party or an organization to lead it, it was
inevitable that the army, better organized than the rest of the social institutions or classes,
would take advantage and seize power. Subsequently, it became evident that the
revolution was faltering, and it was at this moment that the TNO decided to take up arms
and confront the repression of the ruling Dergue regime from the rural frontiers, under
the leadership of the TPLF.
Although the TPLF, as its name indicates, was a nationalist front encompassing
different social classes, the leadership and the leading elements – later known as Merih
Baeta – were disciples of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Tse-tung. They believed that a
socialist revolution would transform Ethiopian society and that rights to self-
determination would be respected. They openly admired what they knew of the socialist
countries for the society they planned to build and for the contributions they gave to anti-
colonial liberation movements everywhere. However, when the Ethiopian military regime
212signed an alliance with the Soviet Union, it became expedient for the TPLF to condemn
the Soviet Union for collaborating with the Dergue in oppressing the Ethiopian people
and to look for an ideological justification to explain the Soviets’ conduct. In the early
days of the struggle, the TPLF had to look for an alternative ally in its revolution. The
Chinese model had a ready-made explanation in ‘revisionism’, which portrayed the
Soviet system as a form of imperialist overlordship, namely ‘social imperialism’.
Initially, the TPLF leadership considered embracing the Chinese model of a ‘New
Democratic’ revolution. This so-called New Democracy led by a communist party was
propagated by the TPLF until the beginning of the 1980s. When the Chinese joined a
party with the ‘national bourgeoisie’ at the strategic objective level, the TPLF condemned
them as another form of revisionism and continued to search for a ‘truly socialist ally’.
Later, the TPLF’s leadership shifted to espousing an independent form of Stalinism, with
Enver Hoxha’s Communist Albania as a model.
Looking at the ideological course the TPLF navigated, the whole objective of the
TPLF leadership boiled down to embarking on ‘a national democratic revolution [to]
pave the way for a planned socialist economy free of exploitation of man by man, in the
interest of the masses’ (Manifesto of TPLF, February 1976: 25-27). For this objective to
be accomplished it was necessary to have a party that could lead the struggle; and this
was later to be found in the MLLT. Within a year of launching the armed struggle, a
TPLF political department, headed by Abbay Tsehaye, was established. Under this
department, a cadre school with Meles Zenawi and others as teachers was created to
produce new political cadres. All the well-educated and high-ranking fighters were
labelled as leading elements (Merih Baeta) and had to attend a number of cadre courses,
after which the ‘communist core’ of the TPLF became functional. As we saw above, it
was this communist core that formed the MLLT in July 1985.
213Forging a Leftist Party
Why a socialist party? The technological strides the Soviet Union made soon after
introducing socialism and Communist China’s apparent ability to feed over a billion
people and with all the indications of advancing at a comparable pace with developed
countries provided the impetus, if not the justification, for the young enthusiasts to fight
for socialism. The anti-colonial ideological position and the political and material support
bestowed on liberation fronts in many parts of Africa by the socialist camp also bolstered
the image of socialism among the students’ generation. None of the younger generation
seemed to escape this revolutionary fervour. This was also the case with those who
started the armed struggle under the TPLF.
From the start of the armed struggle, the TPLF conducted its political activities
more or less as a party with strict ideological guidelines rather than a front encompassing
all sorts of nationalist trends. In its Manifesto in February 1976, the TPLF stated that:
‘The Tigraian national struggle, being essentially a national democratic revolution, has
adopted the programme of New Democracy as its program. … This type of state is to be a
transitory one into socialism and provides the necessary political freedom for the masses’
(pp. 25-26). And at its first congress in 1979, the issue of creating a party was raised and,
without any meaningful debate, all the delegates unanimously agreed on the formation of
a party. If there was any uneasiness on this matter, it came from those fighters who had
naively taken the TPLF to be a socialist party.
The political department and in particular the cadre school under Meles Zenawi
were given the task of organizing the formation of the party. Meles Zenawi was more
delighted than anyone when the CC of the TPLF delegated him the responsibility of
making preparations to form the party. He found suitable space within the Front to
cultivate his own power base without involving himself in the frequent armed clashes.
Kahsay Berhe (2005: 77), a strong critic, candidly put it like this: ‘… Meles Zenawi got
the golden opportunity to avoid his [worst] nightmare, i.e., the danger of physical
214participation in the civil war’. In a trying military assignment at the operations of Adwa
and Adidaero, he ducked his duties on two occasions: ‘He had the whole time to engage
himself in the collection of quotations [and] impress other CC members who had no time
for reading’ (ibid.) due to the on-going war against rival fronts and the Dergue. Also: ‘He
had the possibility to disseminate his point of view as a teacher of cadres and above all
the possibility to train and organize his loyal cadres as his own troops for the struggle of
power within the organization’ (ibid.). From then onwards, the formation of the
proletarian MLLT, was in full swing, with Meles at the centre.
As the head of the cadre school and presiding over its management, Meles
determined the school’s curriculum, which included an impressive array of Marxist
extracts and cadre recruitment procedures. This position gave him the chance to study
one Marxist book after another, which in turn allowed him to become the Front’s chief
ideologue and eventually the head of the future MLLT. More importantly, he was able to
overtly recruit MLLT members and, covertly, create loyal cadres for his own power base.
Indeed, Meles was organizing himself, creating a power base that would bring him to the
top while most of the leaders were preoccupied with thoughts of conducting the war with
the Dergue.
Theoretical materials from the Stalinist era were selected and translated into
Tigrigna to serve as the basic teaching material in the cadre school. Issues like
‘democratic centralism’ were emphatically articulated and practiced. Anything that did
not conform to the Stalinist theoretical framework had no place and was labelled
‘reactionary’, ‘revisionist’ or ‘bourgeois’. Follow-up discussion materials were prepared
and sent to cadres at all levels outside the school and everybody had to internalize what
was written and presented. Special discussion arrangements on selected policy-related
issues were made for the TPLF’s CC at its office in Akmara near the cadre school. At this
level, discussions were not managed as they were in the cadre school. Here, they took a
different course, which could often be confrontational. In one instance, Meles’s deputy,
Alemseged Gebre-Amlak, was sent to present a paper on the ‘scope and limitations of
215democratic rights in a proletarian party’ in connection with the Marxist concept of the
‘dictatorship of the proletariat’. He had the idea that workers should not be allowed to
protest and stage demonstrations against their own party because a party is always
impeccable and would not inflict harm on its members. However, his view was rejected
in the CC’s group discussion by referring to the ‘Critique of the Gotha’ programme
(1875) in which Marx himself had argued for workers’ democratic rights, including the
right to stage a demonstration against their party if they thought it necessary.
While other CC members were mainly engaged in responsibilities related to the war,
Meles Zenawi was busy in the cadre school to create a party reflecting his ideals. Abbay
Tsehaye, the head of the political department, was supposed to oversee Meles’s venture
for the CC but lacked the confidence to check him. As the whole affair of party formation
became Meles’s own domain, it was possible for him to introduce changes at will. The
flow of new ideas slowly became his monopoly and any TPLF member who wanted to
express an idea had to ask permission from the CC, which in effect meant the department
controlled by Meles. This authoritarian practice was later translated into Article 1.2c in
the MLLT’s Constitution, printed in Hamle in 1977 E.C. (July 1985). If the CC’s
permission to express ideas was not granted, one had to take the point for discussion
through a series of meetings of basic units and a regional conference where at least half
of the participants had to support the proposal. This tedious and intimidating process
meant that many were inclined to give up trying to get ideas through and avoided
incrimination in the process. The TPLF’s reorientation of Marxism-Leninism from the
Chinese to the Albanian interpretation was also the making of Meles after he read a
journal sent by the Union of Tigraians in North America (UTNA). The Albanian
conviction regarding the ‘Three Worlds’ theory put the Soviet Union and the United
States of America on the same footing as the ‘First World’ countries, but considered the
former to be more aggressive and dangerous than the latter.
For Meles and his supporters, the Stalinist revolutionary line and the Albanian
version of socialism were truly Marxist-Leninist. The Chinese path, which had embraced
the national bourgeoisie as a strategic ally in its new democratic revolution, was
216discarded as a ‘revisionist system capitulating to the bourgeois order’. The MLLT was to
be constructed on these ideological foundations.
The MLLT’s Founding Congress amid Famine
Preparation for the MLLT’s founding congress, held from 12 to 25 July 1985, had
basically begun already two years before, when a commission, led by Abbay and Meles,
was set up by the TPLF’s politburo. In 1983, during the TPLF’s second congress, Meles,
the de facto leader of the commission, read out a list of names of about two hundred
Merih Baetas (leading elements) who would participate in the congress and be the first
party members.
Two months before the MLLT congress, the TPLF’s politburo convened in
Akmara in central Tigrai to review, among other matters, the Dergue’s attempt of a
military offensive and how to counter it; the severe famine that was affecting central and
southern Tigrai and how to tackle it; and the preparations for the MLLT’s founding
congress. No serious time or thought was, however, devoted to the first two big issues,
that were going to involve the lives of hundreds of fighters and thousands of people. For
the politburo, the preparation of the founding congress was of paramount importance.
Hoping to make the majority of the politburo pay serious attention to the famine,
Aregawi suggested that the formation of the MLLT be postponed until some time after
the famine was over or at least under control. Thousands of peasant families had already
deserted their villages in search of food aid and many were exposed to disease and death
because there was no one to help them. None of the politburo members had the will or the
heart to consider the plight of the people as they were obsessed with the formation of a
party – a party that would put them at a vantage point to fully command the TPLF.
Aregawi’s plea was dismissed as an inopportune if not irrelevant matter. The rationale for
devoting all human and material resources to the formation of the MLLT was that once
this party was formed, all problems would be tackled in a ‘scientific manner and solved
217forever. This blinded the leaders, who shied away from the harsh realities that had
befallen their own people.
A Dergue tactical offensive (not a strategic one like the zemechas) soon resumed
near the Akmara and Worie base areas, but it faced no serious engagement because the
TPLF adopted a tactic of containment with small units. This allowed preparations for the
MLLT congress to continue as planned in Tselemti, at the foot of the Semien Mountains.
The famine, on the other hand, was having a devastating effect. Amid the complications
created by the Dergue’s offensive and the worsening of the famine, many peasants,
especially in central and southern Tigrai, were dying every day from lack of food and
water and related illnesses. The young TPLF fighters, who could have facilitated supplies
of food and water to those in need or provided medical attention to the sick, were fully
engaged in the upcoming MLLT congress.
Dergue offensives usually lasted for weeks, depending on the magnitude of the rebel
counter-offensive, but this time it was over in a matter of days, and government troops
returned to their barracks. However, the famine continued to engulf most districts in
Tigrai and people understandably turned for support to the TPLF, an organization which
claimed to be waging a war on their behalf,. But in vain: the focus of the organization
was on Worie, where the birth of the MLLT was to take place. By early 1985, a congress
hall that could accommodate well over 500 delegates was carved out in the gorge of the
River Worie under Meles’s supervision. It was well-camouflaged to protect it from air
raids and two brigades were stationed near Worie to repulse any enemy incursion.
Logistical preparations for the congress were efficiently executed in advance. While there
was nothing to eat for hundreds of thousands of peasants, a variety of foods and different
types of local drinks were in abundance at Worie awaiting the arrival of the delegates.
The emerging MLLT leadership had organized festivities that were far removed from the
situation of the hungry masses.83
83 There was some irony here, as these very MLLT founders had condemned Emperor Haile
Selassie for the celebrations to mark his 80th birthday in 1972 under impending famine
218It was quite a contrast to see the inside of the fancy congress hall in a remote and
inaccessible mountainous region of Tigrai where most people lived in dilapidated huts. It
was decorated throughout with red ribbons and behind the long podium were large
portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin dominating the entire hall. Paintings that
depicted fighters coming out of the ‘dark’ days under earlier TPLF leadership and
envisaging a rosy future under the MLLT were hanging here and there. One painting in
particular of a man running up to the top of a hill with the message ‘Grab the
commanding heights’ was telling. The message was reiterated and elaborated on with
slogans such as ‘Let the able ones run, the unable follow and the unfit be discarded’. To
‘discard the unfit’ meant to eliminate or purge those who differed from the MLLT’s
ideological and/or political line, and as the slogans suggested, purges and eliminations
did indeed take place later on.
The communist force of the Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement (EPDM)
and some ten other Marxist-Leninist communist parties from Europe and the Americas
were invited to the founding congress. Tamrat Layne, then Meles’s comrade-in-arms, led
the EPDM delegation. While the German ML party sent a Mr. Kafka as a one-man
delegation, the other nine ML parties sent messages of solidarity that were read out on the
opening day of the congress. The entire TPLF politburo, all nine of them, sat on the
podium, with Abbay and Meles occupying centre stage, as had been the case during
preparations. The congress agenda was prearranged. Items for discussion and the
resolutions to follow, including the name of the party (the MLLT), were set in advance.
Abbay Tsehaye was sitting in the forefront of this drama while the actual stage-manager
was Meles Zenawi.
The opening ceremony was ostentatious. Members of the foreign bureau, led by
Seyoum Mesfin, had composed a song for the event that heralded the birth of the MLLT
and delegates were forced to sing whether they wanted to or not. Indeed there were some
silent opponents who were upset about the tragic scenes of famine on one hand and the
conditions, and Lt.-Colonel Mengistu Haile-Mariam for buying large quantities of whisky to
celebrate with his Workers’ Party of Ethiopia (WPE) in the middle of the famine in 1985.
219euphoria of the MLLT founders on the other. The organizing commission began its
deliberations to the congress with an evaluation of the last ten years and the performance
of the TPLF communist core (although there had been no communist core as such in this
period). As explained earlier, it was the left-oriented TPLF leadership with its eclectic
views of socialism that had been leading the movement. The communist core, if it can be
so called, began shaping up only after the formation of the organizing commission in
early 1983. The evaluation of the performance of the previous ten years was designed to
give a sense of purpose and prestige to the MLLT, especially to the efforts of its
architects, and conversely to undermine the original TPLF leaders who had brought the
organization that far.
The main focus of the evaluation revolved around identifying real or imaginary problems
in the TPLF that ‘caused its stagnation’ and to find someone to carry the blame. In the
interview he gave to J. Hammond in Hagere Selam later in April 1991, Meles referred to
‘…the loss of direction in the mid-eighties.… and a period of stagnation set in’
(Hammond 1999: 391). Almost all CC members who were presumed to have contributed
to the alleged stagnation of the Front were subjected to criticism. Meles came up with the
Leninist polemic concepts of ‘empiricism’ and ‘pragmatism’ to elaborate the Front’s lack
of progress and to locate where the fault lay. He argued that the TPLF’s Marxist
principles had been hidden so that the anti-Marxist western community, where relief aid
came from, would not know about them. The TPLF thus failed to develop a strong
relationship with its strategic allies, namely Marxist-Leninist parties worldwide, because
it did not approach them openly. He called this opportunism and classified it as a mistake
of ‘pragmatism’. He also related this failure to the TPLF’s general tendency to depend on
practical experience rather than scientific theory as a guide to all policies. This failure
was again labelled as a mistake of ‘empiricism’ (see MLLT 1985). According to the
above approach of evaluation, nobody in the TPLF leadership seemed to escape blame.
This appraisal was a long-orchestrated drama designed to pave the way for the emerging
MLLT leaders to appear as the redeemers of the TPLF, which was portrayed as inept in
advancing the struggle.
220Based on the above ideological formulations, Meles had already listed a number of
mistakes made by the TPLF leadership and categorized them under the headings of
‘pragmatism’ or ‘empiricism’. On the eve of the MLLT’s formation he picked out certain
members for reproach. Seyoum Mesfin and Asfaha Hagos from the foreign bureau were
his first targets. Although both seemed to concede, neither of them could in fact be
singled out as being responsible for the organization’s foreign relations, as it had been a
tradition in the TPLF leadership to work collectively within agreed guidelines. As no one
else was deciding their own policy, those reproached were taken by surprise and could
neither defend a pragmatic approach for which they were supposed to be responsible nor
challenge the new radical approach Meles introduced. It would on the surface appear that
Meles, who had already organized a group of like-minded cadres behind him, stood for
the textbook ideas of Leninism but he was simply using them to indirectly attack others
who he thought were in his way. It soon transpired that his actual targets of attack were
the vice-chairman of the TPLF and the head of the military department. Surprisingly
though, in the interview referred to above, Meles gave a different version of the concepts
like ‘pragmatism’ that he used to attack others. ‘Pragmatism as I understand it,’ he said,
‘is different from what we are trying to achieve. Pragmatism is going after what is
achievable, not what is desirable. We are going after the desirable, but to us the desirable
is desirable because it is achievable.…’ (in Hammond 1999: 393).
The next part of the appraisal looked into the political principles and positions
adopted by the Front and their implications to date. Five major issues were considered to
be of paramount importance: 1) the right to self-determination; 2) the strategic enemies of
the revolution; 3) the foreign-affairs policy; 4) forging fronts (i.e. alliances with strategic
and tactical friends); and 5) the need for a proletarian party. These issues were discussed
in the cadre school time and again and positions on every issue were also taken by Meles
Zenawi. What remained was to formalize them during the founding congress. Although it
was impossible to change the course of the discussion and its predetermined outcome,
TPLF vice-chairman Giday Zeratsion attempted to challenge the Meles camp on certain
points. ‘Whether the national bourgeois is a strategic ally of the new democratic
221revolution or not, can the petty bourgeois like the proletariat play a leadership role in the
transition from capitalism to socialism’ (Giday 1979 E.C.:58-59) were issues of debate.
Giday could, however, not conduct a normal debate because he was teased and booed by
Meles and his followers. In any case, these what now indeed seem quite abstract
theoretical issues were irrelevant to the Tigraians’ struggle and their dramatic situation at
the time. Famine was killing thousands of peasants throughout Tigrai while the
rhetoricians sat in Worii for a month feasting. There were a few fighters who were
disgusted with the whole episode of party formation. Some did not take part in all of the
discussions and found the occasion inappropriate for serious discussion when the region
was in the middle of the famine. Secondly, the Meles group had already hijacked earlier
ideas of broadening the struggle to the whole of Ethiopia by creating an all-inclusive
united front with independent national or multi-national fronts. Prior to the congress, the
alliance with the EPDM was argued to be the first step in that direction although in reality
the EPDM was an extension of the TPLF in central Ethiopia and not an independent
partner in the struggle. Therefore, the founding congress of the MLLT turned out to be a
discussion forum for Meles and his loyal cadres to juggle Marxist excerpts, and was hard
to swallow for the majority of delegates.84
In light of its self-assigned task of evaluating the ten years’ performance of the TPLF
‘communist force’, the congress took a position on the five issues noted above and
elaborated the points in the esoteric Marxist rhetoric of the day as follows (see the MLLT
booklet entitled ‘Yehiwehat Kominist Hail Ye 10 Amet Guzo Gimgema, Hamle 1977’
(Evaluation of Ten Years’ Performance of the TPLF Communist Force, July 1985,
MLLT 1985c):
(cid:190) On the right to self-determination, the congress concluded that the Front’s position
was broadly correct and free of narrow-minded nationalism, yet some mistakes
that could be categorized as deviations were noted (MLLT, 1985c: 25-26). Close

222observation of the controversial Manifesto 68 drafted by Abbay and Meles in
which an ‘independent Republic of Tigrai’ was set as the TPLF’s objective
revealed that the position was not only one of deviation but also of extremely
narrow nationalism.
(cid:190) On strategic enemies of the revolution, the Dergue as a fascist class, Western and
Soviet-led imperialism as oppressors of all working people and feudalism as a
moribund reactionary system were all classified as enemies of the democratic
revolution. With regard to the Soviet Union, it was labelled as a social-imperialist
force that became an ally of the fascist Dergue and tactically became the main
enemy at the time (Ibid.: 44).
(cid:190) On the issue of foreign affairs, the policy pursued by the foreign bureau was
severely attacked as ‘pragmatist’ and failing to develop anticipated links with
strategic ML friends by focusing on relations with tactical friends who provided
short-term advantages like relief aid.
(cid:190) On forging alliances with strategic and tactical friends, a broader front had to be
formed against reactionary forces of feudalism, imperialism and bureaucratic
capitalism represented by the fascist Dergue. The national bourgeoisie was
classified as a wavering strategic ally.
(cid:190) On the needs of a proletarian party, the congress approved the formation of such a
party in Ethiopia to bring about the ‘new democratic revolution’.
On the last day of the congress, a draft MLLT programme and constitution was read out
and, without any serious debate, the congress adopted both documents.
Organizational Restructuring and Take-Over of the TPLF
After fourteen days (5-18 Hamle 1977 E.C. [12-25 July 1985]) of prosaic discussion
unrelated to the harsh realities facing Tigrai, the congress elected a central committee
(CC) to lead the MLLT. Twenty-one CC members, including Giday and Aregawi, were
223elected. Almost all of the new MLLT’s CC members were former CC members of the
TPLF and the fact that Giday and Aregawi were elected by a larger vote than Meles
indicated that delegates did not appreciate the difference between the MLLT and the
TPLF85 or even the emergence of the MLLT and its dominance over the TPLF. At the
closing ceremony, Meles declared that the ‘Formation of [the] MLLT is a great leap
forward’ and then as a reward for his services Sibhat Nega presented him with a trophy.
Both were elated and their cohorts cheered them for the progress they claimed they had
achieved, but nobody knew where this progress would take them or how long it would
last.
A day later, the 21 CC members of the MLLT and TPLF (in fact the same
personalities in both organizations) convened to elect a politburo and a general secretary
for the MLLT. Before the election resumed, Meles brought charges against Giday and
Aregawi. Close allies of Meles, namely Sibhat Nega, Seye Abraha, Awaalom Woldu and
Gebru Asrat, followed suit. They had prepared a range of charges, from ‘being an
obstacle to the formation of the MLLT’ to ‘contemplating removing Meles’. The
allegations were brought by Meles and his supporters to get rid of their challengers. They
could have brought these charges up during the congress, which had been in session just a
day before, but they did not have credible charges to convince the delegates, who might
have turned down the allegations in an open investigation and further exposed their own
motives. As critic Kahsay Berhe (2005: 83) observed, ‘To avoid any possible division in
the election process, Meles Zenawi chose the plenary session of the CC for the
battleground for the expulsion of Aregawi Berhe and Giday Zeratsion’.
The prosecutors, witnesses and judges were the same MLLT leaders and the
verdict was predictable. Aregawi and Giday were purged from the politburo of the TPLF
and thus disqualified from election to the politburo of the MLLT. The whole process,
which lasted less than an hour, could neither be said to be legal nor democratic by any
standards. So Giday and Aregawi had no option but to submit to a process they were part
of. Sibhat suggested the purges be followed by administrative measures (code words for
85 Tesfay Atsbaha, interview, 25 March 2004.
224incarceration or liquidation) under the Front’s rules, but Meles rejected Sibhat’s scheme
on the ground that such measures might tarnish the ‘blossoming’ name of the MLLT. The
same evening, the delegates were summoned to assemble and listen to Seyoum reading
the CC’s decision on the ‘exclusion’ and ‘disqualification’ of Aregawi and Giday from
both the TPLF’s politburo and the MLLT. Except for two or three questions from
selected loyal cadres, no discussion was allowed on the matter because, as Seyoum put it,
‘…the CC had acted within its limits and did not transgress the bounds of the congress’.
Aregawi demanded his position be heard but Seyoum denied him the right to express his
views or even ask questions like the cadres by stating that everything had been discussed
at the CC meeting.
On Meles’s recommendations, the new CC approved the politburo members’
nominations for the MLLT. The new MLLT politburo and the departments they headed
were as follows:
1. Abbay Tsehaye – Secretary General
2. Meles Zenawi – Ideology and Propaganda
3. Seye Abraha* – Military Bureau
4. Tsadkan Gebretensai* – Chief of Staff
5. Tewelde Woldemariam* – People’s Bureau
6. Seyoum Mesfin – Foreign Bureau
7. Gebru Asrat* – Socio-economic Bureau
8. Awaalom Woldu* – Socio-economic
9. Sibhat Nega – Socio-economic (nominal TPLF chairman)
10. Aregash Adane* – Alternate Member
11. Arkebe Equbai – Alternate Member86
86 The six politburo members marked with an asterisk * were ‘purged’ in 2001 when Meles as Prime
Minister of Ethiopia had a conflict with them over the war with Eritrea in 1998-2000.
225The CC of the MLLT/TPLF continued its meeting for another two weeks to restructure
the new organization and plan activities for the coming four years, i.e. until the next
MLLT congress. As members of the CC, Giday and Aregawi also had the opportunity to
participate in the meetings but with contradictions of ideology and ‘pragmatic’ policy
now transpiring, it became increasingly difficult for them to engage in debate with their
opponents. Of the many differences, one outstanding example suffices to illuminate the
nature of the contradictions in which the MLLT leaders were bogged down. Although
more than one million people were affected by the famine at the time, about 200,000
peasants were instructed to march to Sudan to receive relief aid, a difficult journey that
would take about two weeks. The peasants were exposed to all sorts of adversities,
including aerial bombardment from government MiG fighter planes and attacks from
wild animals. Memhir Haddis, a peasant who survived the journey, told Kassahun
Berhanu (2000: 82) that ‘Several lost their way and ended up as prey to wild animals,
were captured by government troops, or succumbed to hunger, thirst and disease in a
situation where assistance of whatever kind could not be expected’. Treating it as
insignificant news, Seyoum Mesfin reported to the congress that 13,000 peasants died en
route. He did not even mention that the immediate cause was a lack of basic support from
the TPLF/MLLT cadres who at the time were busy with the MLLT congress. As usual,
the culprit was said to be nature not man. The irony was that it was the MLLT leaders
who ordered the long march to take place so that the famine victims could receive relief
aid from Western donors, who they characterized as imperialist class enemies of the first
order. No one from the so-called strategic allies was anywhere near the scene.
The worst part of the contradiction was yet to come and was in the allocation of
the relief aid collected from Western donors by the Relief Society of Tigrai (REST), the
humanitarian wing of the TPLF and now of the MLLT too. By June 1985, REST had
received more than US$100 million from donors in the name of the famine victims.
Abadi Zemo, the head of REST, handed the money to Awalom Woldu of the
TPLF/MLLT’s economic department who in turn reported to the CC that was in session
for budgetary planning. Meles’s proposal for the allocation of the relief aid money was as
226follows: 50% for MLLT consolidation, 45% for TPLF activities and 5% for the famine
victims.87 Aregawi argued that the allotted amount for the famine victims was too little
and should be significantly increased. The Meles group booed and one of them
interjected: ‘…you should understand that if the MLLT is strengthened all problems
would be solved scientifically’. Most of them supported Meles and eventually the
proposal was put into effect. Opportunism it may appear, it was also the contradiction
between an ideology that condemned pragmatic relationships but at the same time made
use of the relationship to pursue its own dream at the expense of a starving people. 88
In brief, the process towards the formation of the MLLT was taken as a successful
achievement by the communist core of the TPLF spearheaded by Meles and Abbay who,
as they claimed in their report of the MLLT congress, ‘….promoted a broad struggle of
ideas in a democratic manner to arrive at such a triumphal stage’ (MLLT, July 1985: 86).
This was democracy of a special kind, adhering to the Marxist principle of dictatorship of
the proletariat and vanguard party hegemony. In such a political structure apart from the
party directives that flow from the top there is no free flow of ideas among members.
This was the case with the MLLT, where ideas came from the top down and had to be
obeyed without question. Free and open debates even in CC circles now became much
more limited, as independent-minded members faced purges and later execution.89 From
here on, it was only the MLLT that defined the course of the struggle ideologically,

88 Before the CC meeting came to a close, once again charges came up against Aregawi and Giday. This
time they were related to instigating fighters ‘to doubt the good intentions’ of the MLLT, followed by a
proposal to purge them from CC membership, which was the responsibility of the congress. Meles now
had a CC he could drive into any direction, at least for some time. The expulsion of Giday and Aregawi
was followed by harassment, defamation and, as Kahsay Berhe (2005: 84) asserts, ‘Meles Zenawi formed
a secret commission to oversee the activities of Aregawi Berhe and Giday Zeratsion, including secretly
looking into their dairies, interrogating combatants who come in touch with them’. This forced both
veteran fighters to abandon the organization they had helped develop and move abroad.
89 E.g., in the case of Teklu Hawaz and Gebrehiwet Kahsay. Teklu was a CC member of the
TPLF and a popular fighter who headed the Department of Public Relations for more than ten
years. He was one of the few CC members who challenged the MLLT on a number of issues. He
was executed in 1989. Gebrehiwet was head of the radio section known as Bado-Bado (00) under
the Department of Military Intelligence. He was a brilliant fighter who many times openly
ctiticized the ideas of the MLLT ideologues at the TPLF cadre school. He was executed in 1990.
227politically and militarily, not only in Tigrai but also in other regions of Ethiopia through
‘obedient’ organizations. It had herewith completed the take-over of the TPLF
Extension of the MLLT to ‘Puppet Organizations’
Article 2 of the MLLT’s Constitution stated that ‘one of the main objectives of this
League is to create a nation-wide Marxist-Leninist party of Ethiopia’ (MLLT 1985b: 5).
This article clearly defined what the MLLT was planning for a future Ethiopia, and how
it was going to execute it was not difficult to comprehend.
In the months preceding the formation of the MLLT, it had become clear that the
Dergue was losing ground on every front in Eritrea and Tigrai, where its presence was
limited to only a few towns. And even there it was in a defensive position. The TPLF
controlled all the Tigraian rural areas and most of the towns, from which it launched
frequent surprise attacks on the Dergue. The morale of the government army was low and
troops were deserting in their hundreds on a daily basis. Crisis in the military hierarchy
was deepening, with attempted coups being followed by harsh measures of repression.
Some well-known generals like Merid Niguse, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, and
Amha Desta, Commander of the Air Force, even committed suicide. Kumlachew
Dejenie, Deputy Commander of the 2nd Army, fled to the United States. Tariku Ayne and
24 other generals were killed by pro-Mengistu soldiers (see p. 219), some of them having
been tried for alleged treason and others without having been court-martialled. In Eritrea
and elsewhere in Ethiopia, the whole military structure was weakened from within.
Conversely, the TPLF had grown to be a formidable force with fighting skills that
had developed over years of painstaking hard work and experience. The TPLF/MLLT
was now in a position to extend its area of operations beyond Tigrai, deeper into central
and southern Ethiopia. Militarily it was possible to do so as the government forces had
lost their fighting spirit and were only poised to retreat from battlegrounds, as POWs and
228deserters invariably reported. However, politically it was a totally different matter. The
larger territory outside Tigrai was a part of Ethiopia where the TPLF had not even made
itself or its programme remotely known. If the rest of Ethiopia knew of the TPLF, this
had only come from the Dergue, and that would have been negative propaganda which
portrayed the TPLF as a bunch of separatist bandits who destroyed bridges, schools and
clinics.
Another drawback was its antagonistic relationship with multinational
organizations like the EDU and the EPRP, who had a vocal constituency on the
conservative and radical spectrum of Ethiopian society, respectively. The fact of both
organizations being chased out of Tigrai after a series of battles that took the lives of
many young Ethiopians (see Chapter 3) contributed enormously to the negative picture of
the Front that the Dergue had been painting. The political support the TPLF offered to the
separatist movement in Eritrea was another position vehemently rejected by most
Ethiopians, and the TPLF was perceived by many as bent on dismantling the unity of the
country. The intention of the TPLF/MLLT to expand beyond Tigrai therefore had to be
seen in the light of these obstacles.
Aware of its political limitations, TPLF/MLLT leaders had been trying to
overcome these setbacks. However, instead of engaging in a political dialogue with the
already existing self-assertive organizations to arrive at a solution palatable to all sides,
they went for an opportunistic option. By forging organizations of like-minded groups
that would not pose a serious challenge to their strategic objectives, they designed a
multinational Ethiopian front or party in which the TPLF and the MLLT respectively
were the nucleus and dominant forces.
Facilitating the formation of the Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement
(EPDM), a splinter group of the EPRP, fell within the strategy of the TPLF/MLLT to
extend its grip on the larger part of Ethiopia. For this purpose, the EPDM received the
full backing of the TPLF/MLLT. Material, political and diplomatic support was readily
available for the EPDM. The EPDM in return promoted the TPLF/MLLT’s propaganda
and political objectives in the regions the latter could not reach, and had little interest in
229doing so. Except for some minor tactical issues, the EPDM stood alongside the MLLT on
basic principles. Not only did it adopt the main resolution of the MLLT founding
congress, but later it created the ‘Ethiopian Marxist Leninist Force’ (EMLF) within the
EPDM, a replica of the MLLT within the TPLF (see Figure 8.1). Like the MLLT and
with the same tone, the EMLF declared ‘the task of the EMLF is to help raise the class
consciousness of the proletariat so that it accomplishes its historic mission of waging a
socialist revolution. Besides it shall facilitate the formation of a nationwide ML party
under which the working class would be organized’ (EMLF Program, 1981 EC: 8-9).
Henceforth, even though the EPDM was declared the strategic ally of the TPLF for the
limited objective of the fronts, the EMLF was thought to be an ally of the MLLT in the
anticipated socialist revolution. To lead the socialist revolution, a nationwide ML party
would be formed from the union of the MLLT and the EMLF. Both the TPLF and the
EPDM had gone as far as initiating and later creating a union of the fronts known as the
EPRDF (Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front). If we follow the pattern,
what remains is the formation of a nationwide ML party that gives the ‘Revolutionary
Democratic’ guidance to the EPRDF, with the MLLT and the TPLF, respectively as the
core group. E.g., some other organizations, like the Oromo People’s Democratic
Organization (OPDO) formed in 1990 under the umbrella of the EPRDF, were to follow
in the same ideological and organizational mould. This pattern was later set on course
nationwide. Meles Zenawi (1990: 24) acknowledged this fact in the People’s Voice by
saying that ‘the MLLT programme was in essence not very much different from those of
the EPRDF and TPLF’.
When meanwhile in 1985-86 the military feasibility of advancing beyond Tigrai
became a reality, Meles Zenawi, whose ‘argument revolved around defending the
liberated areas in Tigrai, and therefore, waging positional war’ (Kahsay Berhe, 2005: 82),
changed his mind and initiated the formation of the EPRDF in which the EPDM was
picked as a junior partner. Once the EPDM joined the EPRDF, it had no choice but to
accept the ideological, political and military dictates of the MLLT, for the former
basically depended on the latter in its war and survival requir ements.

After the EMLF was formed, the TPLF/MLLT had a free ride in realizing their model all
over Ethiopia. It could now strike enemy positions anywhere in the country in the name
of the EMLF. The south of Tigrai and the adjacent provinces of Wollo and Gondar
became immediate areas of operation. As operations were intensified and more territory
fell into the hands of the fronts, the EPDM’s dependency on the MLLT was growing, for
it had neither the physical capacity nor the material resources to manage the ‘liberated’
areas. The TPLF/MLLT was managing these on behalf of itself and the EPDM, thereby
deepening its grip over the later. Success on the military front obviously led to a
broadening of the MLLT’s political project.
231The TPLF/MLLT was also paying due attention to political developments north of
Tigrai - in Eritrea - to see if it could initiate the MLLT’s broader project. As a party that
had the ambition of forging an Ethiopian proletarian party, it had no ideological barrier
restricting it from extending its range into Eritrea, to create an Ethio-Eritrean proletarian
party. This ideologically driven intention of the MLLT leaders was reflected in their
warm relations with the ELF splinter groups, namely the Democratic Movement for the
Liberation of Eritrea (DMLE) and the ELF-SAGIM. These groups were opposed to the
EPLF and were being groomed in a more or less similar fashion to the EPDM. They had
secured the full support of the TPLF/MLLT. Support for the DMLE and SAGIM
obviously meant strengthening the position of an alternative ally in Eritrea, as opposed to
the EPLF, which in their eyes had embraced ‘Soviet social imperialism’. This alignment
would eventually lead to ideological conformity which could be the basis for establishing
a unitary proletarian party. However, before this grand project matured, the military
campaign against the Dergue had to be concluded, and indeed the stage was being set for
the final showdown.
The imminence of this attracted both the TPLF and the EPLF, the strongest
military forces in Ethiopia/Eritrea, to reach an agreement and hasten their drive to power.
Meles and Isayas of the EPLF once again renewed ties in order to deal the final blow to
the weakened Dergue. Confident of the military forces they had amassed, both fronts
believed the victory would easily clear their way to power. Their renewed relations
became so warm that Meles had to put his project with the DMLE and SAGIM on hold.
Yet the logistical support the TPLF/MLLT used to dispense to both organizations
continued to flow, with their offices and base areas remaining intact. These confused
relationships, bizarre as they may seem today, were calculated moves by the MLLT
leaders, to use the DMLE and the ELF-SAGIM - as they used EPDM/EMLF - as
ideological partners / stepping stones to power in the new political arenas of both
Ethiopia and Eritrea and itself keep the upper hand. Politico-military developments at the
time, however, were pressing to consummate the venture undertaken with the powerful
EPLF. (See for more details, Chapter 10 below).
232After gaining military backing from the strong EPLF in the final march to power,
Meles came back to his ideological allies, the DMLE and SAGIM. Voluntarily or
otherwise, the DMLE and SAGIM had no option but to accept the deals the MLLT
leaders promised. There was no other reason why sworn enemies of the EPLF should be
close friends with the TPLF/MLLT. The relationship with the EPLF went well for some
time after the Dergue was overthrown, only to turn bitter in 1998 at the beginning of a
two-year war. The good relationship with the DMLE and ELF-SAGIM, on the other
hand, continues to this day. This may indicate their common ideological origin, but also
the felt need to balance Eritrean forces against each other.
The Ideological Trajectory of the MLLT since 1985 and the Development of
‘Revolutionary Democracy’
In November 1985 (Hidar 1978 EC) Meles Zenawi had written a paper entitled
‘Afelalayatna ab Gilsti Medrek Nekrib’ (Let’s Present Our Differences in Open Forum)
in which he insisted on the need to bring ideological or political differences into the open
and discussing them in public. It seemed somewhat paradoxical to blame others for not
openly disseminating the objectives and principles of the MLLT in its struggle for
proletarian internationalism, as openness and collective decision-making was much more
the rule before that after the installation of the MLLT.
Under the leadership of Meles, the MLLT went on to solidify its ideological and political
hold on the TPLF and to make its ideology the basis for alliance-building on its own
terms.
In 1990 a further organizational development occurred, with the founding of the
‘Ethiopian Proletarian Organizations Unity’ (EPOU) under the leadership of the MLLT.
It was to bring together the MLLT and the EMLF. This was supposed to be the nucleus of
a nation-wide Marxist-Leninist organization under the guidance of the MLLT/TPLF. The
233fate or existence of this organization is not known, but likely is that it was also subsumed
under the EPRDF (under TPLF politburo leadership).
Later, the development of the ideology of ‘revolutionary democracy’ proceeded,
and it was kept in place until this day and regularly discussed. As it is an outcome of
MLLT thinking and as such still important, I make a brief excursion forward to illustrate
this. During a TLPF cadre conference in Meqele in 1994 the leadership, mainly Meles
Zenawi, extensively lectured about the concept of ‘revolutionary democracy’ as an
appropriate doctrine that ‘had to be firmly grasped’ if Ethiopia was to embark on
sustainable economic development.
What was the ‘revolutionary democracy’ that Meles Zenawi was describing at this
point in time? The idea of revolutionary democracy originated from the theses of Lenin
on ‘Bourgeois Democracy and the Proletarian Dictatorship’, presented on 4 March 1919
to the First Communist International. Lenin was committed to establishing revolutionary
democracy in place of parliamentary democracy, which he defined as ‘bourgeois
democracy’. Meles Zenawi borrowed this idea from Lenin, who meant a political formula
of rule under a politically trained vanguard party representing ‘the masses’, which would
develop national ideological guidelines, consult with the constituency but not accept
changes from it, and implement ‘the correct policies’ from the top down.
Revolutionary democracy was explained in more detail the recent evaluation of
the internal situation of the governing party, the EPRDF, known as the Gimgema Papers
(Papers of Appraisal/Evaluation, see EPRDF 2001b), a very revealing and defining
political document. There the author (PM Meles Zenawi) declared that:
The world is now cowering to the international network of globalisation. We have
to chart our way to develop in this system. … Even though Ethiopia is now a
basket case, it can move stage by stage and achieve a top developed nation status.
… Ethiopia can achieve this if it is guided by ‘revolutionary democracy’. Whereas
Liberal Democracy is partial wager, a collector of rents, and a representative of the
234comprador bourgeoisie, ‘revolutionary democracy’ stands for sustainable
development (cited in Milkias 2001: 34-35).
Furthermore, he argued that:
The only democracy that is possible in Ethiopia is ‘revolutionary democracy’. …
When revolutionary democracy permeates the entire Ethiopian society, individuals
will start to think alike and all persons will cease having their independent outlook.
In this order, individual thinking becomes simply part of collective thinking because
the individual will not be in a position to reflect on concepts that have not been
prescribed by revolutionary democracy. (ibid.: 36)
One further key suggestion of Meles Zenawi’s and the top EPRDF leadership’s Marxist-
Leninist approach – evident in the above-cited, undemocratic views - was their apparent
adherence to Stalinist ideas, in both theory and practice. The Stalinist dictum of the ‘right
of nations to self-determination, including and up to secession’, was emphatically
pursued by them from the start. The party also promulgated Stalin’s secession option
after the take-over of power in 1991, in both the Transitional Charter signed on 22 July
1991 by Meles Zenawi as the transitional leader of the country and in the Federal
Constitution, ratified on 8 December 1995 and operative to this day. Article 2c of the
Charter and Article 39.1 of the Constitution proclaim that ‘Every nation, nationality and
people in Ethiopia has an unconditional right to self-determination, including the right to
secession’ (italics added by author). This often-repeated clause is found in Stalin’s work
on Marxism and the National Question (1942). Furthermore, elements of Stalinism can
be seen in the purging and persecution before and after 1991 of those with different
political views: the executions of Commissar Atsbaha Dagnew (Shewit), Gebrehiwet
Kahsay (a head of TPLF radio intelligence), Teklu Hawaz (a TPLF CC member), Alula
Gebru (a media officer) and many others are cases in point.
235Close observation of the ideological stance, the formulated policies and the
practice of executing them in Ethiopia reflect what the MLLT stood for since its launch
in July 1985. One is thus inclined to believe that the MLLT in some way still is operative,
e.g., as an old-boys’ network. In the light of the contentious status of the MLLT, the
methodological operations of this organization may be seen from two different angles.
On the one hand, to allure Western liberal politicians and donors and keep aid money
flowing to the government, the leadership tells the world that they had nothing to do with
a Marxist-Leninist party. That was what is done in press interviews and in, for instance,
US Congress Subcommittee hearings by party members before the 1991 take-over. This
raises the question of how the former MLLT leadership or its successors are able to sway
the donor country leaders and democrats who have no stomach for Marxist ideology. No
answer will be pursued here. One can perhaps conclude that a hybrid of ideologies -
namely the outer trappings of democracy (parties, periodic elections, a constitution) and
‘revolutionary democracy’, with the latter holding ultimate sway - constitutes the outward
political symbolism and rhetoric prevailing in the Ethiopian state. It can also be argued
that the MLLT has served its purpose and Marxism has now been officially transformed
into ‘revolutionary democracy’.
Until the early 1990s, the MLLT leaders were consistent in their Marxist-Leninist
ideology and autocratic (if not Stalinist) like methods of policy implementation. As noted
earlier, members who put forward alternative views or showed even slight deviations
from the established line were treated as enemies, or ‘class enemies’ as they were called.
Even comrades who posed tough questions were condemned as revisionists or thought to
have ‘reactionary influence’. Those who failed to comply were further labelled
‘pragmatists’ and/or ‘empiricists’. Considering these actions and reactions, one might
think that the MLLT leaders were firmly attached to their ideological commitments. But
in 1991, with the success achieved on the military front and the ascent to power just
beginning, the MLLT membership appeared to make an ideological U-turn. It was not,
and still is not clear whether it was a clear denial or a shift in ideological position – it was
certainly not made public. In any case, some form of ‘pragmatism’ and ‘empiricism’ or,
236in the eyes of many, naked opportunism, began to emerge, not from the rank and file as
such but from the founders and leaders of MLLT, notably Meles Zenawi. Around this
time the Socialist bloc, especially the former Soviet Union, was in collapse with the tide
of glasnost and perestroika, and one could assume that the MLLT might have been
feeling the impact. However, the same Socialist bloc was still characterized by the MLLT
as being ‘social imperialist’ and ‘destined for ruin’. So the fall of the Soviet Union might
have been interpreted as a blessing in disguise and may not have influenced the MLLT to
seriously shift from its own Marxist-Leninist position.
Summary
The motivation for the formation of a communist vanguard party, the Marxist-Leninist
League of Tigray (MLLT), emerged among one sub-group wishing to have full control of
the Front and follow a new, strict ideological policy. Since a ‘Front’ by definition is an
organization of people with different ideological and political background but coming
together to accomplish a limited common objective, the various trends in the organization
could be checked and put under control only if a one-party system was operational. Here
probably lies the reason why the militant elite of the TPLF was seen to require an ultra-
leftist party. The establishment of a communist party did however not reflect the overall
interest and aspirations of the traditional peasant society of Tigrai.
The party was forged gradually in a semi-clandestine fashion to avoid possible
resistance from the rank and file of the Front or the general population of Tigrai. First, by
organizing the educated section known as the ‘leading elements’ or Merih Baeta of the
Front, and through them by reaching out to the larger section of its active members, the
party was declared operational in 1985, ten years after the formation of the TPLF.
According to the Marxist ideology of the party, industrial workers, which were actually
insignificant in numbers, and the peasantry were the social forces which should take the
mantle of the leadership of the ‘proletarian Marxist party’. In practice, however, it was
237the elite of the TPLF which controlled the leadership positions and used both the leftist
ideology and the organization of an MLLT. The party eventually stretched down to
village-level cadres as a means of controlling and centralizing the activities of the Front.
Using the high reputation the TPLF had gained in the 1976-1985 armed struggle
fighting against heavy odds, the leaders of the MLLT began to extend beyond Tigrai by
helping the creation of MLLT-replica parties in other Ethiopian organizations like the
EMLF (Ethiopian Marxist-Leninist Force) as a Marxist party that guided the EPDM. In
this context in 1990 the ‘Ethiopian Proletarian Organizations Unity (EPOU)’ was
nominally formed, bringing together the MLLT and the EMLF. Whether it ever took up
its supposed role of nation-wide Marxist-Leninist organization is unknown.
Before this ambitious project took shape, the TPLF was confronted with the
dilemmas generated by the end of the Cold War and the demise of the Soviet Union and
its bloc, and also with the impending defeat of the Dergue. Just before TPLF/EPRDF’s
decisive military victory in May 1991, the MLLT and the other ML organizations
retreated into oblivion, without any public pronouncement about their dissolution. This
retreat could be considered as an expedient and pragmatic move. But the ideological
heritage lived on in the ‘revolutionary democratic’ approach of the TPLF/EPRDF.
In this chapter we have clearly seen that an important sub-group of the TPLF
political elite, opportunistically or as a matter of principle, used the MLLT to establish
dominance inside the movement and beyond. This happened after the military successes
scored by the TPLF on the battlefield in the period 1976-1985. That new elite dominance
did not go away with the apparent retreat of the MLLT in 1991 and after. By invigorating
and supporting ‘ethno-nationalist entrepreneurs’ all over Ethiopia to forge their own
ethnic-based organizations after 1991, they continued to play a dominant role and
prevailed over other contenders to political power. As for the MLLT, whether functional
or not, it has already served its purpose; it has been the vehicle of empowering the
political elite of the TPLF.

The TPLF and the Eritrean Fronts: Backgrounds of a Tense Relationship
Introduction
Primordial components may in large part explain the relationship between the people of
Tigrai and Eritrea, through shared linguistic (Tigrinya) and socio-cultural characteristics,
but the modern political elite, especially the leaders of the Fronts in both populations
opted to tune in to post-colonial developments to define the relationships between the two
peoples, and thereby develop quite diverging objectives for their political struggles.
Indeed, the desire of both peoples for political freedoms and rights to self-determination
was certainly there, but the interpretation of the peoples’ needs was left in the hands of
the two groups’ elites, who wanted to create their separate political domains. The
interactions between the Eritrean and Tigraian elites who ran (and still run) the Fronts
were complicated by two conflicting factors: the need for close cooperation to fight a
strong enemy, the military government, and the urge to come out of the struggle as a
dominant force in their own region. For this purpose, ethno-nationalist and nationalist
mobilizations coated with exclusivist future political goals were taking place in Tigrai
and Eritrea respectively. In this process, the relationship of the Fronts had to pass through
numerous twists and turns, at times boiling over to armed confrontation. This in turn had
a negative influence on the relationship of the two peoples.
This chapter is devoted to analysing the relationship of the Tigraian and Eritrean
nationalist Fronts, which constituted the main forces that brought down the Ethiopian
military government in 1991. In both cases, the participation of the ordinary people in the
239struggle was crucial, yet they could not have a say in the decision-making processes. The
competing nationalist outlooks and the impact of the competition on future relationships
of the two people on both sides of the colonial divide as well as its effect on the political
conditions of the region will also be assessed.
Historical Background
To understand the alternately acrimonious and apparently warm relationship between the
TPLF and the Eritrean fronts, one needs to look into the long history of that war-ravaged
region and the different perceptions of its history. In the minds of the peoples of both
Ethiopia and Eritrea, there is a sense of both intimacy and enmity. It was the combination
of old antagonizing factors coupled with current developments and ambivalences that led
the former fronts, now the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments, to the war of 1998-2000.
It should be clear from the outset, however, that the interpretations of the region’s
history – as put forward by the political elites on both sides of the Mereb River – are
varied and eclectic. To begin with, it is relevant for the study to contrast the two
divergent views of the same historical subject. Let us take two representative assertions.
The press and information department of the Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs wrote
in 1976: ‘Ever since Ethiopia emerged from the distant horizon of time as a body-politic,
its northern part, including the area now called Eritrea, has been at the beginning and at
the centre of its development. Ethiopia has never existed without this northern part. Nor
has this part ever been identified separately from Ethiopia’ (cited in Mesfin Araya 1988:
9). In contrast, the Eritrean Liberation Front’s Revolutionary Council wrote in 1989:
‘Ethiopia’s chimerical reference and legendary claims over Eritrea are, therefore,
unhistorical and have nothing to do with the past and present realities in Eritrea and
Ethiopia’ (ELF-RC 1989: 3).
It is clear that the two positions represent essentially opposed interpretations of the
region’s history, but behind them laid political objectives that came to the fore in their
240respective programmes. It is this historiography clouded by objectives emanating from
differing political interests that seems to define the volatile history and recent military
events in the region. Although the divergent discourses, especially that espoused by the
Eritrean fronts, have capitalized on a mutually exclusive evolution of the Tigrigna-
speaking people in the same region for the purpose of justifying secession, the historical,
religious, cultural and kinship ties of the two peoples divided by the Italian colonial
boundary line since 1890 manifest a deeper relationship (see Marcus 1994; Alemseged
Abbay 1997, 2004). These bonds are still there and could not be simply erased by the
relatively short period of Italian colonialism or by the dictates of a political elite aspiring
to create its own ‘kingdom’. The same is true for the Afar and Kunama peoples, who live
on both sides of the arbitrary Italian colonial boundary. Eritrean independence, as such, is
a manifestation of a position adopted by the Eritrean elite for pragmatic reasons and not
so much as an historically tenable undertaking. Although the details of the subject are
beyond the scope of this book, a schematic historical review of the region in the ancient,
medieval and modern periods is sketched below to help understand the present and
ponder over the future.
The present people in the northern part of Ethiopia, including Eritrea, are the result
of successive waves of migration and subsequent integration with indigenous people.
There were several power centres in the region that expanded and contracted with the
movements of external and regional adversaries. Some four centuries before Islam was
introduced into the region, the Christian Aksumites controlled the area. When Islam
emerged, the two religions developed harmonious relations for some time but this did not
last longer than the lifetime of the Prophet Mohammed. Concomitantly, certain cultural,
linguistic and religious traits of particular significance persisted over the centuries.
Sedentary Christian highlanders and pastoralist Muslim lowlanders (many of whom first
were Christians) had their separate power centres, beginning with Aksum in the 1st
century, later in Yifat and then in Adal after the 8th century. The interplay of religion,
environment and language seems to have shaped their cultural and psychic make-up,
which in turn influenced their socio-political relationships during their entire existence.
241Earlier, between the 1st centuries BC and AD, Aksum emerged as the overlord of
the various regional power centres. The Aksumites controlled much of present-day
Tigrai, Eritrea and the Red Sea coastal areas and also made several incursions across the
Red Sea into southern Arabia. ‘The Aksumite campaign into South Arabia is recorded in
the inscriptions of Adulis (AD 277-90), which relates how the king of Aksum waged
war’ (Caetani 1911: 366-67). In its heyday, Aksum was one of the world’s great maritime
powers, using the port of Adulis, south of the present port of Massawa in Eritrea. In the
words of the Iranian prophet Mani (216-276 AD), cited in Kobishchanov’s book Axum,
‘There are four kingdoms on earth: the first is the kingdom of Babylon [Mesopotamia]
and Persia; the second is the kingdom of Rome; the third is the kingdom of the Axumites;
the fourth is the kingdom of the Chinese’ (Kobishchanov 1979: 59). Kobishchanov goes
on, ‘From the second half of the III century AD, Axum began to mint its own coinage.
The introduction of its own coinage indicates the significance that market relationships
had acquired in the Axumite Kingdom’ (ibid.: 185). As R. Fattovich said, ‘The power of
the kingdom [Aksum] derived primarily from the control of the trade from the African
hinterland to the Red Sea, through the port of Adulis on the gulf of Zula (Eritrea)’ (2000:
3). The old road from Aksum through Yeha in Tigrai and Tokonda and Kohaito in Eritrea
to the port of Adulis can easily be traced by ruins and inscriptions that indicate a
functioning and stable trade route. ‘The archaeological remains dating to this period at
Aksum, Matara, and Adulis show the same basic futures and suggest a common cultural
pattern stretching from the Tekeze River to the Red Sea coast, ...’ (ibid.: 20). Tringali
(1965), who conducted pioneering archaeological surveys at forty sites in and around the
outskirts of Asmara, found that many contained Aksumite pottery ‘…correcting the
mistaken impression that there was not much Aksumite settlement in the Asmara region’
(Kobishchanov 1979: 19).
The Aksumites embraced Christianity during the early part of the fourth century
and ‘developed their own civilization, as illustrated by their script Ge’ez, their number
system, Kutir, and their calendar, Awde-Awarih, which are still in use at the present time’
(Belai Giday 1983; Teshale Tibebu 1995; Aregawi 2004), not to mention their splendid
242architecture seen in the standing obelisks, religious structures and tunnels in Ethiopia as
well as present-day Eritrea. The Aksumites translated the Scriptures from Greek into
Geez, which served as the country’s literary written language for centuries. Aksum ‘was
not only the religious centre of the country, but the capital of the kingdom’ (Budge 1970:
123). Christianity, Ge’ez and the crown became the uniting factors of the Aksumite
kingdom in the centuries during which present-day Eritrea was a component. From
ancient times, these three factors were the basis of unity and identity for the people of the
kingdom, including the Eritrean Christians. Up to this period, relations with the emerging
Muslims were harmonious, allowing some of the earliest Muslims who had crossed the
Red Sea earlier for fear of persecution living under protection of the Aksumite king, and
in 628 ‘Mohammed himself, now in authority, sent an emissary to Ethiopia to request the
return of his followers’ (Henze 2000: 42-43)..
Between 630 AD and 640 AD, a powerful wave of Arabs with the mission of
spreading Islam began attacking the Red Sea coastal plains. Early on, the Aksumites
resisted by dispatching their fleets and enjoyed some victories. ‘The Khalifa Umar al-
Khattab is reported to have dispatched a small naval expedition against an Abyssinian
fleet in AD 640, but the Arab fleet suffered so disastrously that Umar would have no
more to do with the sea’ (Caetani, cited in Trimingham 1952: 46). Eventually though, the
Arabs continued to penetrate the mainland, and in the 8th century took control of Adulis,
the main port of Aksum, thus bringing an end to its maritime trade in the Red Sea area.
Throughout the second part of the 8th century, the Arabs continued their assault on the
lowland hinterlands, spreading Islam and blocking the trade routes of Aksum with the
outside world.
To make matters worse for Aksum, in the first half of the 10th century, a powerful
pagan queen, Yodit, emerged from the Agew lands, south of Aksum, and gave another
blow to the kingdom in 970 A.D. She burned churches, demolished historic obelisks and
disrupted institutions, causing the influence of Aksum to further decline. This eventually
gave rise to a new dynasty called Zagwe, which came from Lasta, south of Aksum. They
made the centre of their kingdom there and ruled for almost 350 years until they were
243overthrown in 1270 by Emperor Yekuno Amlak. Despite these problems, the deeply
rooted Christian order and political culture remained intact and continued to revive
throughout the highlands of Abyssinia as far as Debre Bizen in Hamassien, the monastery
along the escarpment overlooking the Red Sea. ‘After all, Aksumite civilization was still
the dominant political and cultural element up to the medieval times’ (Sergew 1972:
267). The same culture, religion and language (Tigrinya) have prevailed to this day in
highland Eritrea and south of it in Tigrai, northern Ethiopia. The same is true of the
Islamic societies inhabiting the lowlands of the same region. In the areas to the South, the
centre of the new ‘Solomonic empire’ of Yekuno Amlak, Amharic had developed.
Once Aksum fell, the centre of power was forced to shift further southward. From
Lasta it moved to Shewa and later to Gondar, leaving behind fractured power
principalities. Supported by the Arabs across the Red Sea, Islamic offensives launched
from the Kingdom of Ifat and Adal in the Afar lowlands continued to be a menace to the
Christian regions. This Muslim attack from the east, although it blocked the spread of the
Christian culture and diminished its political prevalence, could not penetrate the high
Abyssinian hinterland. Thus the legacies of Aksum continued to operate and provided the
basis of legitimacy for later Emperors who were confined to their defensible highland
plateaus. Any new emperor had to travel to Aksum, which remained as the ecclesiastical
capital of Ethiopia, to be anointed and be acclaimed King of Tsion and of Aksum. The
centralized Ethiopian Orthodox Church served as a pivotal force among Christian
highlanders and the historic Ethiopian nationhood for centuries to follow.
Throughout the medieval period, the legacy of Aksum was reflected in its written
religious literature, religious education, political system and trade, and this remained the
basis of a unity and identity of the people of ‘Abyssinia’. The Kebre Nagast (Glory of
Kings) compiled between 1270 and 1285 and the Fetha Nagast (Law of the Kings)
produced in 1400 on an earlier Egyptian text were sources of judicial legitimacy and a
symbolic-normative measure of the kingdom’s stability. The Tigrigna-speaking people of
northern Ethiopia were bound together by this heritage and to this day, the majority of the
Hamassien, Seraye and Akele Guzay people of Eritrea (estimated to be about 2.5 million)
244remain Coptic Christians and speak the Tigrigna language, like their kin in Tigrai
(estimated at 3.5 million). Intermittently, they used its common name – Tigrai-Tigrigni
(Pan-Tigrinya). Another common name that includes many of the people in the central-
north of Ethiopia is ‘Habesha’, and elderly Eritreans, along with their kin to the south, are
often proud to be called Habesha.
From the 14th century, the Ottoman Turks, and later on the Egyptians, occupied the
eastern lowlands of Eritrea. The northern defence line of the Aksumite Kingdom was
repeatedly attacked from different directions, yet the Emperors always worked to regain
the Red Sea coastal territories and ensure access to the sea. Now that the invasion was
launched by Islamists against the Christian state, the confrontation took on a religious
dimension. Beginning in the reign of Yikuno Amlak (1270-1285), the restorer of the
Ethiopian monarchy, and throughout the reigns of Amde Tsion (1314-1344) and Yishaq
(1413-1430), all the kings attempted to restore the status of Aksum. Expansion of
Christianity was one integral aspect of their mission. Evangelists like Ewostatewos of
Geraälta, central Tigrai (1273-1352) and Filipos, the founder of the Debre Bizen
monastery (1323-1406) and their followers made tremendous strides in instituting
monasteries throughout the region, thereby strengthening the normative grip of the
Christian monarchy over their historic domain. Several monasteries were also built in the
region now known as Eritrea. Among them, situated in the northern tip of their kingdom
is Bizen, not far from Asmara. ‘Bizen represented the movement of Christian expansion
characteristic of the fourteenth century’, (Tamrat 1972: 260). Emperor Zer’a Ya’eqob
(1434-1468) upgraded the title and status of the ruler of the region now known as Eritrea
and part of Tigrai from Melake Baher (emissary to the sea) to Baher Negash (sea region
ruler). With the intention of re-instituting maritime trade, external relations and control of
the coastal region, ‘Zer’a Ya’eqob started building his own sea-port at Girar, on the
mainland opposite the island of Misiwwa’ (Kolmodin, cited in Tamrat 1972: 261).
Like all semi-autonomous regions in highland Ethiopia, the Seraye, Hamassien
and Akale-Guzay regions in present Eritrea were ruled by their own rulers under the
sovereign power of the Ethiopian monarchy. With the intention of centralizing his
245kingdom, Zer’a Ya’eqob, as Perruchon (1893: 45-48) said, ‘…grouped together the
districts of Shire, Sara’e, Hamsen and Bur, and placed them under one administration
entrusted to the Bahir-Negash’. But this administrative arrangement was to change with
the coming to power of another king. Such change could be observed during the reign of
Susenyos (1607-1632), when ‘the ruler of Hamassien (Mereb Melash) in the early 17th
century, a certain Tesfazion Ateshim, was appointed by King Susenyos’ (Ghelawdewos
1998: 1, cited in Medhane Tadesse 1999: 4), suggesting that Hamassien was ruled as one
administrative district of the Kingdom of Susenyos (1607-1632). It is, therefore,
reasonable to conclude that ‘…in the specific history of highland Eritrea, a consolidated
hereditary aristocratic class hardly emerged. The rise of the semi-autonomous status of
‘Bahr Negash’ office, (i.e., governorship of highland Eritrea), and its decline since the
16th century is highly indicative’ (Longrigg, cited in Mesfin Araya 1988: 39).
Furthermore, during the reign of King Iyasu (1682-1706), the Turkish Na’ib at Massawa
had to pay tribute to Aksum and ‘caravan connections were maintained with Massawa via
Adwa, with Sudan, and through Gojjam to the southwest’ (Henze 2000: 103).
Even during the Zemene Mesafint, from 1769 to 1855, (the Era of Princes) when
Ethiopia was parcelled among local chieftains and the coastal area was controlled by the
Turks, Abyssinian/Ethiopian dominance of the port of Massawa was not severed. Ras
Mikael Sihul, ruler of Tigrai, his successor Ras Wolde Selassie of Enderta and later
Dejazmach Sebagadis Woldu of Agame maintained their influence over Massawa despite
their engagements with bellicose rivals.
In 1855 Emperor Tewodros, who rose to power in Gondar, brought about the end
of the Zemene Mesafint and the beginning of a unified modern Ethiopia. To realize his
vision, he made sure local leaders remained loyal to his throne and paid tribute. The
highland regions in Tigrai and Eritrea constituted part of the loyal regions in his
kingdom. ‘Dejjach Baryaw Paulos, governor of Northern Tigrai, Dejjach Hailu Tewolde
Medhin, governor of Hamasen and Seraye, and Bashai Gebrezghi, governor of Akele
Guzay respectively paid 35,000, 32,000 and 17,000 Maria Theresa thalers to the state
treasury annually’ (Bahru Zewde 1991: 32). ‘Ras Wolde Michael, whom the EPLF
246presented later as the forerunner of ‘Eritrean nationalism’ was a vassal of the Emperor
Tewodros (1855-1868). He conducted all his correspondence with foreigners in
Amharic…and gave his children typical Amharic names – Mesfin, Mekonnen Merid, and
so on’ (Kindie 2005: 24).
During the second half of the nineteenth century, the Egyptians attempted to
penetrate deep into highland Eritrea. Emperor Yohannes IV (r. 1872-1889), who
succeeded Tewodros, dispatched his accomplished general Ras Alula Engida and under
his leadership Ethiopian forces defeated the Egyptian army at the Battle of Gundet in
November 1875 and Gura in March 1876. After the defeat and retreat of the Egyptians,
the Italians, under the auspices of the United Kingdom, seized Massawa in February
1885. The Ethiopian general, with his seat at Asmara, engaged the Italians for years and
finally ‘Ras Alula soundly defeated the Italians at the Battle of Dogali (near Massawa) in
1887, the major setback received by any European power at the hands of an African
Army, though only a sample of what was to happen nine years later at Adua’ (Hess 1963:
105). Erlich adds, ‘His victory over their forces at Dogali in January 1887 was a
landmark in their imperialist history’ (1996: x). The remaining Italian forces fortified
their position at Saati, to which Emperor Yohannes advanced halfway in order to
dislodge them. Had it not been for the invasion of the Sudanese Mahdists in the northwest
of the country, which forced him to change his former plan, that advance might have
brought an end to the Italian presence in the region. To the relief of the Italians,
Yohannes died at Metemma on 9 March 1889 while fighting the Mahdists. Soon the re-
enforced Italian army began encroaching on the highlands of Serae up to the River
Mereb, and in January 1890 the Parliament in Rome declared this part of Ethiopia and the
adjacent lowland regions a colony to be called ‘Eritrea’, going back to the old Roman
name Mare Aerythreum (Red Sea). Thus began the colonial history of Eritrea, a precursor
of Eritrean nationalism. The 1890 Rome Declaration set the political geography of what
is now known as Eritrea and the nationalism that has appeared since then.
The Italians were not content with only occupying the region they named Eritrea.
Their aim was to colonize the whole of Ethiopia. Thus they continued their encroachment
247on the hinterland until they were stopped at Adwa in 1896 by the united Ethiopian forces
under Emperor Menelik. They were then contained in Eritrea for the next four decades
until 1935, when they again launched their invasion of Ethiopia, which lasted until their
defeat in 1941. During these years of war and occupation, Eritreans in their thousands
fought against the invaders like any other patriotic Ethiopian. Studies conducted by
Salome Gabre-Egziabher (1969), Seifu Abbawollo (1960), Gerima Yafere (1956),
Tadesse Mecha (1951) and Alazar Tesfa-Micael (1948) to mention but a few, give a
lengthy list of Eritrean patriots who fought for the independence of Ethiopia, of which
Eritrea was a component.
After the cession of the present Eritrean region to Italy in 1890, relations between
the people on both sides of the imposed border remained intact but latent, as they fell
under separate administrations. The Eritrean regions of Hamassien, Seraye and Akele
Guzay in the northern highlands, the Afar in the eastern and the Kunama in the central-
west lowlands remained connected with their kin on the Ethiopian side of the border.
After all, ethnically they were the same people; they spoke the same language, had shared
the same history for centuries, and also continued economic relations.
With the defeat of the Italians in the Second World War and without the consent
of the people, the British took over Eritrea and ruled from 1941-1952. But after a
diplomatic fight, Emperor Haile Selassie succeeded in claiming back Eritrea by a federal
arrangement under his crown from 1952-1961. The federation, however did not last
long.90 Against the provisions stipulated in the federal agreement, ‘By 1955 the
federation was de facto dismantled. In place of Arabic and Tigrigna, Amharic became the
official language. In 1959 the Eritrean flag was removed’ (Mesfin Araya 1988: 170).
Except for negligible numbers of Christians like Woldeab Woldemariam who envisaged
a secular autonomous Eritrea and a few Muslims like Sheikh Suleman Aldin Ahmed who
joined the unionists, the population was divided into two major blocs largely on the basis
of religion with Christians mostly approving union and Muslims opting for separation.
Supported by the unionist block which had 32 of the 68 seats in the federal parliament
90 For a fascinating history of the Federation, see Tekeste 1996.
248and against the advice of his far-sighted Prime Minister Aklilu Habte-Wold, Emperor
Haile Selassie dismantled the federation and declared Eritrea to be the fourteenth
province of Ethiopia in 1962. With the gradual break-up of the federal arrangement, the
Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) was formed in 1961 in the Muslim-inhabited western
lowlands. Hamed Idris Awate, formerly a junior officer in the Sudanese army and on-
and-off a bandit (shifta) preying largely on the Kunama, joined later and made it an
armed insurgent group in 1962. ‘By mid-1964 … first foreign assistance came from
Syria’ (Osman Salih Sabbe, cited in Habte-Selassie 1980: 64), which was indicative of an
emerging Islamic alliance. As the ELF remained Islamist for some years to follow,
followers of Woldeab and some liberal Muslims opposed to the ELF came together to
form a secular movement which later evolved as Eritrean People’s Liberation Front
(EPLF) in early 1972. It was this EPLF that forged an alliance with the TPLF to finally
overthrow the Ethiopian military junta.
In a brief period of about 65 years (compared with their long history sketched
above), the Eritreans experienced Italian colonialism, British ‘trusteeship’ and finally
federation with Ethiopia – a period of political discord and unrest rather than a stable
evolution that could revive their historic and historical identity. It was in the middle of
the period of federation that the old dichotomy in Eritrean society began to emerge. As
we saw, the Christian highlanders mostly opted for unity with Ethiopia while the Muslim
lowlanders wanted to stay outside it. Some were liberal Muslims, others die-hards and
still others pro-Italian, while the Christians fell into one unionist organization. As the
unionists looked for support from their kin in Ethiopia, many of the Muslims yearned for
not only political but also spiritual sustenance from the Arab world. Initially Egypt
intended to subsume the region; later support was given by Syria, Libya and Saudi
Arabia.
Reciting the long history of the region, the Tigraians in Ethiopia saw the Eritrean
people and the land as part of their joint history. This link is based, among other relations,
on the fact that ‘Eritrea was an integral part of the Ethiopian Empire for centuries with
the exception of the period of Italian and British colonial occupation and the federal
249years’ (Addis Birhan 1998: 31). True, as Tesfatsion Medhanie (2007: 132-133)91 wrote
‘History as been badly abused in the course of the liberation struggle. It has not merely
been misconstrued, but has also become the subject of fraudulent discourse’. Although
influenced by elite politics which emphasized exclusiveness at times and parochialism at
others for the sake of sectarian interests manifested by both the Tigraian and Eritrean
elite, there is still great affinity between the divided peoples, as the longstanding cultural,
religious, linguistic and kinship ties kept on revitalizing the historical bonds. Tigraian
sympathy and support for the Eritrean cause, though short of secession, emanate from the
sense of tangible affinities and of belonging to the same historical roots, and later, when
Tigraians began to challenge Amhara national domination, it was expedient for them to
forge closer cooperation with the Eritrean fronts. The TPLF enjoyed a warm reception
and hospitality from Eritrean peasants in the adjacent regions of Seraye and Akele Guzay.
The forces that worked against the unity of the Ethiopians and the Eritreans apparently
found the affinity of the divided people a liability in their project. Despite this affinity
and to promote the forging of an independent state, the Eritrean elite portrayed Ethiopia
as a colonizer like the Italians, and their movement as an anti-colonial struggle ‘…to
reconstitute itself as the new ruling class’ (Mesfin Araya 1988: 32) in a separate state of
Eritrea. And ultimately, in 1991, through an EPLF-sponsored referendum, this class
achieved its goal, the independence of Eritrea. Of course, as Tesfatsion Medhanie (1994:
57) observed, ‘There were many who felt there was no environment which allowed
opposition groups, especially those who may not favour Eritrean independence, to
organize themselves and freely campaign for their positions’.
91 In this book Tesfatsion Medhanie critically discussed how Eritrean writers like Tseggai Isaac
(2001) distorted history. For instance, the defeat of the Italians who ventured to occupy the whole
of Ethiopia by the combined Ethiopian forces, Eritrean patriots included, under Menelik at Adwa
1896 was presented as the defeat of Menelik, who ‘forfeited’ Eritrea to Italy while Eritrea was
already in the hands of the Italians long before the Adwa war.
250Launching the TPLF and the Eritrean Connection
When the seed of the Tigraian national movement sprouted at the campus of the Haile
Selassie I University in the early 1970s and the Tigraian National Organization (TNO)
was formed it was expedient for the Tigraian group to forge relations with their Eritrean
counterparts. The TNO sought contact with the two Eritrean fronts simultaneously, the
EPLF and the ELF, through their members at the Haile Selassie I University. For the
TNO members, it was not difficult to contact EPLF activists and because of its leftist
stance it had some sympathy among the radical students at HSIU and they were easily
identifiable. Both sides knew each other from a distance, particularly regarding the
question of nationalities and self-determination in Ethiopia, and also because of their
common language, Tigrigna. However, tracing ELF activists was not so easy because
their supporters were found mainly outside the university campus and working more
covertly.
Amid this radical activism and through his individual efforts, Teklai Gebre-
Mariam (‘Aden’), an Eritrean born in Adwa, Tigrai, managed to contact the ELF and
enlisted in 1973, but his involvement was short-lived. To his dismay, the outspoken
‘revolutionary’ Teklai-Aden found the ELF far below his expectations, as he found it as
bogged down in deep crisis fuelled by religious and regional animosities. He abandoned
the Front and returned to his home in Adwa, where he was welcomed by militant
Tigraians who were waiting for first-hand information on the fronts. Unexpectedly, he
took a dim view of the dominant Islamic stance within the Front. His assessment of the
ELF negatively influenced Tigraians who had started forging a political organization to
fight the regime and were seeking collaboration with the ELF. Ignoring Teklai Aden’s
assessment of the ELF, some of the activists, for example Amare Tesfu and Tekeste
Wubneh, went to Eritrea and contacted ELF officials in their turn. At that time, a group
of Tigraians led by Yohannes Tekle-Haimanot and Gebre-Kidan Asfaha were forming
the TLF and being trained by the ELF. Amare Tesfu and Tekeste Wubneh joined the TLF
251on the ELF’s recommendation. The other group, which subsequently formed the TNO,
went its own way and established relations with the EPLF.
Although it was known that another Tigraian group, the TLF, was training and
operating with the support of the ELF, the TNO group was keen to maintain cautious
contact with both Eritrean fronts. This was not without reason. The TNO was aware of
the fact that the ELF had a wider area of operation, including along the borders with
Tigrai, which could serve as a safe zone of retreat if the enemy’s offensive in Tigrai
would be unbreakable. The EPLF, on the other hand, which in general seemed to be an
ideological match for the TNO, was already supporting another Ethiopian organization,
the EPRP. This situation left the TNO uncertain about its relations with the EPLF. So, the
leaders of the TNO found it expedient to recognize both Eritrean fronts as legitimate
representatives of Eritrea and pushed to establish relations with both. However, this
strategy had difficulties because these Eritrean movements were in furious conflict.
Under such circumstances each front wanted to support an organization that represented
its organizational interests and could be an ally against its rival.
The formation of the TLF and its apparently warm relations with the ELF drew the
EPLF and the TNO together. The TNO approached the EPLF through the intermediary of
clandestine EPLF cells in Addis Ababa. Without any sign of hesitation or complaint, the
EPLF agreed to train recruits and provide armaments and ammunition for the future front,
the TPLF. It appeared that the EPLF was desperately looking for an ally amongst the
Ethiopians. Mahari Tekle (Mussie), a Tigraian by origin and a fighter in the EPLF,
became the contact person and, as he revealed later on, he intended to pursue the cause of
self-determination in Tigrai. Furthermore, the EPLF consented to his demand to join the
nascent Tigrai Movement. It was common for young Tigraians who found themselves at
odds with the government of Haile Selassie to join an Eritrean front to fight, and many
such fighters joined the TPLF at a later stage.
The organizers of the TNO co-opted Mussie into its ranks and made him a
member of the founding leadership of the TPLF which led the organization until a
fighters’ congress was held. On 18 February 1975, the leadership and some recruits went
252to Dedebit in rural Tigrai and launched the TPLF-led national armed struggle (see
Chapter 3). The launching of the TPLF in Dedebit was also a message to the Eritrean
fronts making it clear that the Tigraian movement, with or without their help, would
advance.
TPLF and ELF Never Went Along Well
The formation of the TPLF, which had established warm contact with the EPLF in a short
period of time, was not good news for the ELF. Its rival front, the EPLF, which was
contained in the northern terrains of Eritrea, had now found an ally in the south which
would share the opportunity of wider mobility that the ELF had monopolized so far.
From the beginning, the ELF showed its aversion to the TPLF by turning down all its
efforts to establish good relations. In April 1975, just two months after it was established,
the TPLF dispatched a delegation to the ELF Seraye administrative unit (better known as
No. 9) and made known its intentions to set up working relations with the ELF. This
initiative was conveyed to the highest bodies in Barka, their base area. Soon after, the
ELF held its 2nd National Congress, which delegates of the TLF and representatives of
Ras Mengesha Seyoum (later the leader of the EDU) attended. The TPLF was not invited,
despite its efforts to maintain contact. Not discouraged by the rejection, the TPLF made
extra efforts to contact the TLF and through that endeavour tried to ameliorate relations
with the ELF. It was also thought what had begun as good relations with the TLF would
help contribute to fixing the gap the ELF had created and forge better relations with the
latter.
In November 1975, relations with the TLF itself suddenly ended. After news of
the atrocities committed by the TLF against its own members began to spread like wild-
fire, rank and file members of the TPLF, among them Meles Zenawi, Yemane Jamaica
and Sibhat Nega, started agitating for action to be taken. The TPLF leadership then called
an emergency meeting to discuss the matter and because the situation was getting out of
253hand, it was left with no option but to take action against the TLF. The TPLF forcefully
subdued the TLF and put the surviving leaders under arrest (see Chapter 4 for the details).
It was an unexpected turn of events for all parties, the TLF, the ELF and the TPLF itself.
A few days later, the TPLF, confident of the righteousness of its measures against the
TLF, informed the ELF and invited them to assess the episode for themselves. The ELF
sent two of its senior officials, a central committee member and a division commander, to
Tigrai to discuss the matter with the TPLF’s leadership. They also had the chance to talk
about the matter in private with the TLF leaders under arrest. The delegation had nothing
negative to say about the drastic measures taken by the TPLF. The TPLF demanded that
the outcome of their investigation be reported in written form to all ELF members so that
relations at all levels would be comradely. But top ELF leaders, who feared the exposure
of their involvement in the TLF misdeeds, never released any such statement. It should be
recalled that prominent members of the TLF, like Tekeste Wubneh, Yohannes
Andebirhan, Berhe Tewldebirhan and Teklai Gebrezgi, were executed with the consent of
Salih Shume and Mohamed Kiduwi, both leaders of the ELF at the administration unit
no.10. The ELF delegation must have been embarrassed by this and related facts which
the TLF leaders revealed.
For the moment, the discussions seemed to have cleared future relations between
the TPLF and the ELF. In fact, the ELF dropped the issue of the TLF and the question of
the prisoners, altogether and began to focus on future cooperation. As a goodwill gesture,
it also granted its consent for the TPLF to retain the arms it captured from the TLF. These
firearms initially belonged to the ELF, which had every right to claim them. Such ELF
moves were thought to be signs of bridging the gap with the TPLF, but it was not clear
how the relationship would develop, for the ELF’s top policy engineers were based far
away in the Barka lowlands and would not be expected to change their attitudes towards
the TPLF as long as the latter’s contiguity with the EPLF was not severed.
As a matter of fact, the initial warm relations between the TPLF and the EPLF had
been one of the reasons for the bad relations between the TPLF and the ELF. From the
outset, the EPLF had portrayed itself as a revolutionary front that would embrace and
254work with the Ethiopian revolutionary left, and was accommodating the EPRP and the
TPLF. The first TPLF recruits were trained and armed by the EPLF, an initial indication
of a serious alliance. Two long-time EPLF fighters – Mussie and Yemane Kidane (a.k.a.
Jamaica) – who were both Tigraians by birth, were transferred to the TPLF for good.
Mussie in particular was instrumental in maintaining the relationship with the EPLF
when it experienced problems. The organizational name TPLF resembled that of the
EPLF as did the TLF that of ELF. In the ELF camp, the rhetoric surrounding class
struggle, socialism and dictatorship of the proletariat entertained by both the EPLF and
the TPLF created the suspicion of a rising unified revolutionary force. This was
happening at a time when the ELF was claiming that it was the only legitimate
representative of all sections of Eritrean society. On top of that, the ELF’s perception of
the EPLF as an organization of Tigrigna-speaking highlanders from Eritrea who were
ethnically the same as the Tigraians in Ethiopia decisively shaped its attitudes towards
the TPLF as an ally of its rival, the EPLF. Besides, the permanent presence of ELF cadres
along the borders with Tigrai and their confrontational dealings with Tigraians living
there was another area where relations were difficult. TPLF-ELF relations were,
therefore, strained from the beginning by many factors and remained fragile all along,
sometimes even turning violent.
For the top ELF officials, who were always seeking surrogate organizations in
Ethiopia, the liquidation of the TLF in itself was understandably annoying. From then
onwards, the ELF invariably supported any organization in Tigrai that was in some kind
of armed conflict with, and could potentially weaken, the TPLF. In 1976 and 1977, the
ELF provided the Tigraian Movement Coordinating Committee (Teranafit) and its
umbrella organization the Ethiopian Democratic Union (EDU) with military information
on the TPLF. Since the operational areas of both the TPLF and ELF in many cases
overlapped, it was possible for the ELF to pass sensitive military information to the
Teranafit and the EDU on the mobility and strength of the TPLF. This had happened on
several occasions, as the TPLF’s radio interception unit could prove, and indeed was a
‘stab in the back’ of the TPLF.
255Later, in 1978, the TPLF destroyed the Teranafit by waging a counter-offensive
and also evicted the EDU from Tigrai. It seized armaments and ammunition from both
adversaries that bolstered its morale and strength. The TPLF became a formidable force
in western Tigrai and began full mobilization of the people without encountering any
resistance from its former rivals, the Teranafit and the EDU. Once again, the ELF did not
have any choice but to accommodate the TPLF, and relations between the organizations
appeared to improve. By the end of 1976, the TPLF had managed to establish formal
relations with the ELF but they only lasted for a brief period. This time the ELF gave the
TPLF few arms and ammunition, which the TPLF needed but was not desperate for. It
also lifted restrictions on the TPLF outlet to Sudan through western Eritrea. The ELF also
assisted the TPLF on the diplomatic front, introducing it to Arab regimes such as Saudi
Arabia, Syria and Egypt, which offered advantages to the TPLF. However, friendly
relations did not last long. Despite the support the ELF was providing, the position of the
TPLF as far as the EPLF (the former’s rival) was concerned did not falter and this must
have annoyed the ELF. ‘The ELF also endeavoured to get the TPLF to accept its political
positions over those of its rival, the EPLF, something the TPLF was reluctant to do’,
(Young 1997: 113). The administration of Eritrean peasants who settled in the Tigrai
region was another source of continuous disagreement which the ELF took as
provocation. When the TPLF began to execute its land-reform policy which favoured
poor peasants, Eritrean landlords living near the borders were seriously affected. The
ELF stood up on behalf of these landlords and worked covertly and overtly not only to
frustrate the land-reform policy but also the TPLF’s entire politico-military venture. It
defended and offered sanctuary to feudal Eritrean or Tigraian elements opposed to the
land reform and committed acts of reprisal against members of the TPLF or even
ordinary TPLF sympathizers. The ELF protected such opponents of the TPLF by
claiming that they were members of its organization. Repeatedly, its units obstructed the
mobility of TPLF members or vehicles travelling to or from the Sudan through their
territory.
256In the middle of all these tense circumstances, war broke out between the TPLF
and the EPRP in April 1978. Once again the ELF was quick to grab the opportunity and
use it against the interests of the TPLF. The EPRP army, which was operating in Tigrai,
was defeated and driven out of its base area in Alitena and Assimba by the TPLF in a
matter of days and fled to the ELF-held territory of Shumezana in Eritrea. It was
unexpected for the ELF to act as a host for the EPRP because they had no formal
relations and until then, the latter was known to be an ally of the EPLF, the ELF’s arch
rival. But all of a sudden, the ELF gave the EPRP sanctuary in its base area near Augaro
in western Eritrea close to the TPLF area of operations. The cooperation between the
ELF and the EPRP put the TPLF under a serious threat of war. The TPLF wrote a number
of letters of reconciliation to the ELF and in May 1978 leaders of both the ELF and the
TPLF met in Barka. They agreed to work together and not interfere in each other’s
administrative territory. They spelled out their differences, particularly on the nature of
the Dergue and the Soviet Union – the ELF considered the Dergue and the Soviet Union
as ‘truly socialist’ and ‘progressive’ forces, while the TPLF held that both were anti-
democratic and anti-revolutionary. Yet they agreed that such differences should not
hamper the progress of their cooperation as long as they were fighting against both of
them. Subsequently, they went as far as putting together their forces to challenge the
Dergue’s biggest military campaign on the Shire front in May 1978.
At this time, the ELF rearmed the EPRP and began supporting the latter’s plan of
establishing itself in Wolkait in western Tigrai. To accomplish this, the ELF had to escort
the EPRP through TPLF-held territory in western Tigrai where it had created popular
support. At the end of 1979, three ELF battalions under Tesfay Tekle, a member of the
ELF revolutionary council, joined the EPRP forces to cross to Wolkait but they were
attacked by TPLF forces at Moguee and forced to return to Eritrea. Reinforced by another
fresh brigade, the joint forces of ELF-EPRP advanced to Sheraro, the popular base of the
TPLF. But on 6 April 1980, they were intercepted by TPLF forces in the hilly terrain of
Gemmahlo and suffered a heavy defeat. The troops of both defeated fronts were in
disarray, each blaming the other for what had befallen them, although it was the
257endurance coupled with the TPLF’s better fighting tactics that brought about their defeat.
Thereafter, the ELF refrained from attacking the TPLF in the western part of Tigrai while
the EPRP made a long march of retreat to reach remote areas of the Wolkait region. The
EPRP had difficulty reviving its forces and was then engaged in a survival strategy. The
implication of this war was that it frustrated attempts by the EPRP to launch an
operational zone in western Tigrai and Wolkait and to open a corridor from its bases in
Gonder to ELF territory in western Eritrea and eventually to Sudan. Once again, the
TPLF proved to be invincible in the eyes of its adversaries.
By November 1980, furious ELF units operating across central Tigrai launched
another surprise attack on the TPLF base area in Belesa-Maihamato. They chased away
the few guards they encountered and looted the small base area before returning to their
own territory. This was an unprovoked attack, and the TPLF was in no position to and
had no intention of declaring war on the ELF. By this time, the former had emerged as
the only formidable armed resistance force to the Dergue in Tigrai. The destroying and
eviction of the TLF, the Teranafit, the EDU and finally the EPRP was, however, a
message that the ELF had to consider seriously. The fact that it was now left without
proxy organizations in Tigrai indicated its isolation. Confrontation between the TPLF and
the ELF from then onwards became direct and had to be resolved one way or the other.
The TPLF and ELF operational areas were adjacent. The ELF operated in many
parts of Tigrai for military and economic reasons. The border claim and counter-claim
and the exclusive right to operate in the border territories continued to be a constant
problem in relations between the organizations. The policies on land, trade, the mobility
of people and the forceful extraction of material contributions and recruits from Eritreans
living in Tigrai continued to cause strain between the TPLF and the ELF. The ELF’s
border security officers declined to discuss seriously the problems with TPLF cadres and
seek solutions to the problems. The ELF wanted to impose their way and in the final
solution resorted to killing TPLF cadres and trying to overrun their base areas. Conflicts
became frequent, nerve-racking, and sometimes bloody. The ELF created a situation that
was unbearable for the TPLF and even more so for the people of Tigrai along the borders,
258and, day in day out, they urged the TPLF to do something about it and to drive away any
ELF unit. The TPLF had thus many reasons to remove the ELF.
At the very beginning of 1981, the EPLF, which since its formation had been in a
similar – if not more hostile situation – with the ELF, sent a delegation led by Sibhat
Ephraim, a politburo member, to the TPLF to try to resolve the lingering problem with
the ELF. By this time both seemed to have had enough of ELF provocations and they
agreed on organizing equal numbers of forces to deliver a decisive blow to the ELF. In
mid-1981, combined TPLF-EPLF forces began their offensive from the Afar lowlands,
the eastern base area of the ELF and swiftly advanced on the central and western bases.
Without joint action, the war with the ELF would have remained an impossible task for
the EPLF alone. Weakened by internal squabbles and stretched over a wide area in small
units, the ELF was in no position to pose any meaningful resistance. In less than two
weeks, the entire ELF force was forced to leave Tigrai and Eritrea and flee to Sudan
following the impact of the joint TPLF-EPLF attack. Nharnet Team, an ELF sympathizer,
described the situation as follows:
The aggression on the ELA [ELF army] started and the TPLF of Ethiopia joined
in the fratricidal war declared by the EPLF that lasted till 10 August 1981. The
ELA was forced to withdraw to the border areas in the Sudan where it faced
many problems. During that fateful period of 1980-81, the ELA lost 1458
fighters martyred mainly in the destructive war provoked by the EPLF/TPLF
alliance (Nharnet, 2005: Part VIII).
TPLF-ELF relations had been rocky from the start and continued to be so despite the
conciliatory gestures made by the TPLF. At last it had led to this bloody confrontation in
which the ELF was defeated and ceased to exist as a viable organization. The defeat of
the ELF opened up the opportunity for the EPLF to control rural Eritrea without a rival.
The TPLF too had nothing to fear from behind for some time to follow. This was also a
259relief for the Tigraians living along the borders. Afterwards splinter groups formed, made
up of dispersed ELF members, and they vowed to continue the struggle for independence.
They were against the rival EPLF and even those who looked to espouse Marxian
ideology took no time to establish a relationship with the TPLF. Later, the TPLF began to
support the Eritrean Democratic Movement (EDM) and the Eritrean Liberation Front
Central-Command (ELF-CC), better known as Sagem, as a countervailing force to the
EPLF. A new alignment that would complicate relations with the EPLF was in the
making.
The TPLF and the EPLF: Cupboard-Love Relationship
From the beginning, the TPLF-EPLF relationship was an amorphous connection, but on
the side of the militant Tigraians, who counted on historical, cultural and kinship ties, it
was believed the new relationship with the EPLF would work. There was the perception
among TPLF members that the EPLF elite was well-educated and could articulate and
extend the long-standing relationship between the two peoples beyond what Italian
colonialists had created in the 1880s and 1890s. However, considering the attitude of the
EPLF that transpired in due course, it was by and large external circumstances, i.e., the
pressure of a common enemy that propelled the relationship to work. Yet unlike the
larger section of the ELF that was from the outset influenced by Islamist lowlanders, the
EPLF had a clearer picture about cultural and political developments in Ethiopia in
general and in Tigrai in particular, largely because of their affinity and exposure to kin
across the Mereb River. Contacts between EPLF activists and militant Tigraians had
started much earlier, during the Ethiopian student movement of the early 1970s.
When the militant Tigraians were confronted in 1974 by an aggressive military
force, the Dergue, that sought total obedience from everybody, they were in outright
defiance and searched for support in order to launch armed insurgency. It was imperative
for them to look for such support from the EPLF. But EPLF leaders, on the other hand,
260were hoping to find an ally in Ethiopia that could cooperate in expanding their theatre of
operations. It was a time when the EPLF was badly in need of support from Ethiopian
sympathizers in its efforts to dislodge the remaining government forces concentrated in a
few towns in Eritrea. The well-publicized news of ELF-TLF joint operations inside
Ethiopia in early 1975 must have motivated them to quickly link up with a Tigraian front.
These circumstances led the TPLF – EPLF relationship to start before it had had time to
conduct formal discussions or agreements. There seemed to be enthusiasm in the EPLF
camp for supporting a Tigraian movement at this juncture, which led to the forging of
working relations between the two fronts.
After the initial connection was established, modalities of cooperation were
expected to be set and political positions discussed and agreed upon, but the EPLF
instead offered in advance to train as many recruits as the TPLF could mobilize. It was an
attractive offer the TPLF could not afford to waste. It focused on seizing the opportunity
and on finding recruits to be engaged in fighting the enemy. The formalities that would
define the relationship between the two organizations were therefore ignored and
informal contact became the defining aspect of the relationship.
Initially the cooperation appeared to go smoothly, but the EPLF’s support for the
TPLF did not match the latter’s expectations. Many reasons could be attributed to this
shift of attitude on the part of the EPLF: perhaps because the relationship was not based
on a formal agreement, or existing relations between the EPLF and the EPRP might have
created reluctance of the EPLF towards the TPLF, or perhaps supporting a struggle for
the self-determination of Tigrai might have set an unwanted precedent for Eritrea.
The EPRP was then considered the strongest revolutionary party and indeed had
huge numbers of followers all over Ethiopia. It was also widely believed to assume
power sooner or later. The EPLF too seemed to believe this. For the EPLF, its
relationship with the EPRP was thus much more important, as the latter claimed to
represent the whole of Ethiopia. And when compared with the EPRP at that time (1975-
76), the TPLF was just a small ethno-nationalist movement with fewer followers.
However, there were some sticky political problems for both the TPLF and the EPRP
261regarding Eritrea. While they recognized the struggle for the Eritrean independence as
genuine, they had differences as to whether the case was a ‘colonial issue’ or not.
Without conducting the necessary study or having appropriate discussions, the TPLF held
the view that the Eritrean case was a ‘colonial question’, as the EPLF wanted it be. It was
probably an opportunistic stand, designed to outflank the EPRP from the privileged
position the EPLF offering it. Without understanding the consequences that were to haunt
it in the discourse of Ethiopian political history, this position continued to be the stand of
the TPLF for years to come.
Another concern of the TPLF was what the removal of the TLF from the scene,
which took place as early as November 1975, would mean for the EPLF. The ELF’s
wider mobility, supported by a proxy organization in Tigrai, might have prompted the
EPLF to initially look for its own proxy organizations in Tigrai to counter its rival. But
once the TLF had been dissolved, the EPLF had less need to worry about the ELF’s
activities gaining ground in Tigrai and beyond. That situation appeared to reduce the
TPLF’s importance for the EPLF and gave more weight to its relations with the EPRP.
Towards of the end of 1975, differences between the EPRP and the TPLF surfaced
when they were operating in the same territory and trying to mobilize and organize the
same people. News of rivalry between the two was also coming from the towns. On the
initiative of the TPLF, leaders of both fronts met in Marwa in January 1976 to look into
these encounters and consider possible remedies (See Chapter 5, section Words and
Bullets – Battles with EPRP) The TPLF presented a suggestion that it thought would
benefit both organizations and avoid them overlapping and clashing. The TPLF requested
that the EPRP operate in regions of the country that the TPLF could not reach. By
implication, the suggestion was recognition of the TPLF as the viable front that could
take care of the struggle in Tigrai against the common enemy, the Dergue. As we saw
earlier, the demand infuriated EPRP delegates and they broke off the meeting and enmity
was created. This was a concern for EPLF leaders, but their main worry was that a
fragmented or ethnically based movement in Ethiopia might weaken a viable future ally -
the EPRP. Eventually, TPLF military action, like that launched against the TLF, would
262deprive the EPLF of an ally expected to seize power in Ethiopia and the anticipated
acquiescence to handle the Eritrean question would evaporate. The EPLF continued to
exert pressure on the TPLF to come to terms with the EPRP and in a letter to the TPLF,
the concerns of the EPLF were clearly stated, with an underlying warning note. For
strategic purposes, the EPLF stood beside the EPRP and influenced by their leader’s
desire to work with the EPRP, EPLF top cadres urged Ethiopians, and especially
Tigraians in Eritrea, to join the EPRP and not the TPLF.
In the first half of 1976 the TPLF unexpectedly had released its controversial
manifesto, better known as Manifesto 68 (see Chapter 5). In this handwritten document,
the TPLF declared that its struggle was for Tigrai’s independence from Ethiopia, which
was basically the same claim the Eritrean fronts had put forward for their region. Earlier
this position had been entertained by the TLF but it was vehemently rejected by the TPLF
on the grounds that there was no historical or political justification for it. It was a surprise
to many fighters to see their organization come up with such an unwarranted claim. The
EPLF also opposed the TPLF manifesto for independence on the grounds that Tigrai was
an integral part of Ethiopia and there was no justification for secession from Ethiopia. At
this time, the EPLF was reluctant to support separatist movements in Ethiopia, not just as
a matter of principle but for various other motives as well. First, supporting separatist
movements might have given the Ethiopian regime extra ammunition to accuse it of
working against Ethiopian unity and for fragmentation. Second, it feared that the growth
of separatist movements in Ethiopia might blur the alleged distinction between Ethiopia
and Eritrea as two different political entities and the propaganda line it held to that end.
Henceforth, EPLF support for the TPLF seemed to be conditional, i.e., the TPLF’s
subordination of its programme to that of a unified Ethiopia through the right to self-
determination. Although the EPLF position in this case appeared quite palatable to many
Ethiopians, one could not conclude for sure that it was adopted as a matter of principle,
given their presentation of Eritrean history as having no connection with Ethiopia. Also,
in light of the EPLF’s continued support for secessionist organizations like the OLF and
263the ONLF, that stand would seem to have been an act of opportunism rather than a matter
of principle.
The politico-military developments in Tigrai between 1975 and 1977 had not been
conducive to cultivating good relations between the TPLF and the EPLF. Tigrai then
became the operational field for several anti-Dergue fronts, among them the TLF, the
TPLF, the Teranafit-EDU and the EPRP. Ethno-national or multinational groups were all
seeking the backing of one or the other or even both Eritrean fronts. The radical TPLF
was involved in armed conflicts with almost all the fronts in Tigrai – the TLF, the
Teranafit and the EDU. While these had the ELF on their side, the TPLF had only the
nominal support of the EPLF, which was simply watching events take their own course.
The TPLF had already managed single-handedly to deal with its two rivals. Later, when
the war rhetoric between the EPRP and the TPLF was increasing, the EPLF manifested
its worries by dispatching a letter of warning to the TPLF, threatening to sever relations –
a threat that did not worry the TPLF. As a result, the EPLF turned a deaf ear to the
TPLF’s request for assistance, while the former’s relationship with the EPRP remained
amicable and supportive. In its turn, the EPRP reciprocated by declaring its support for
the EPLF. In their joint statement of 3 March 1976, it was stated that: ‘The EPRP
unconditionally supports the Eritrean people’s struggle for their independence. It as well
supports the political and armed struggle waged by the EPLF for the independence and
liberation of the Eritrean people.’ Whether the term ‘colonial’ fitted the Eritrean question
in relation to Ethiopia remained controversial, and the EPRP pledged to ‘…study the
question and take a stand accordingly’. On the other hand, the EPLF maintained its
benevolent and opportunistic stand towards the EPRP until the latter was driven out of
Tigrai by the TPLF.
After the TPLF having defeated the TLF, EDU and Teranafit, its confrontation
with EPRP that had been brewing at the isolated cadre level, moved to organizational
level. In April 1979, war broke out and in a matter of a few days the TPLF drove the
EPRP out of Tigrai. The TPLF came to control the entire Tigraian countryside. The EPLF
may have been disappointed about the loss of a potential ally, but there was nothing it
264could do except to continue building an alliance with the rising TPLF. Cooperation
between the EPLF and the TPLF became not only possible but essential, with the Dergue
receiving massive military assistance from its ally, the then Soviet Union, and with a
series of offensives imminent. However, close cooperation did not materialize until the
point when the Dergue’s invasion threatened their very existence.
In 1977, Somalia had invaded the eastern regions of Ethiopia. The Ethiopian
military regime was caught by surprise because its attention was on the northern rebels.
The Dergue decelerated its military engagement against the revolt in Eritrea and the
newly emerging rebels in Tigrai. It mobilized against the invasion of Somali forces,
which was much easier to deal with by pursuing conventional warfare. It was also easier
for the Dergue to mobilize Ethiopians regarding the invasion of Somalia than the
rebellion in northern Ethiopia. It raised a huge army and secured armaments from its
allies in the Eastern Bloc, particularly the Soviet Union. In a series of decisive
engagements the Ethiopian army repulsed the invading Somali armed forces. The
Ethiopian army’s morale was high and after the victory the Dergue immediately switched
its offensive military force to the northern rebel movements, mainly targeting the Eritrean
fronts. For the Dergue, the TPLF was not yet a serious threat at the time and it was
thought it could be easily squashed on the way to Eritrea.
With the cooperation of the TPLF in Tigrai, the Eritrean fronts made desperate
attempts to contain the Dergue’s massive offensive but were not able to halt it. The EPLF
made a strategic retreat from previously held territory and dug trenches in Sahil, in the
northern tip of Eritrea. The Dergue pursued the EPLF and threatened to break its well-
entrenched line of defence in Sahil, where Nakfa was the only town not to have been
captured by the Dergue. The EPLF army stood firm in the rough terrain in Sahil and
repulsed a series of government attacks supported by air power. But it was not clear how
long it could sustain this offensive and what the point was of fighting a pitched battle
against a force whose material and human resources were far superior. As a result of
repeated engagements, the EPLF line of defence was growing weaker with every passing
day and towards the end of 1979 it was desperately looking for fresh recruits to replenish
265its army. The EPLF was in need of support from the TPLF for its own survival and was
forced to revitalize the ailing cooperation with the latter. It presented a request to the
TPLF for immediate military support and for access to the Eritrean community in western
Tigrai to find recruits. The TPLF was willing to cooperate as long as the common enemy
was weakened or engaged in Eritrea – an enemy force which could have created havoc
had it been deployed in Tigrai. From a strictly military point of view, it was also to the
TPLF’s advantage to contain and weaken the enemy outside Tigrai in Eritrea, but it did
not agree with the static military strategy the EPLF had adopted in confronting the
Dergue’s forces and made this clear to the EPLF. The TPLF decided to offer calculated
support that could be called off at any time.
It would have been expedient for both the Eritrean fronts, the EPLF and ELF, to
forge an alliance and challenge what they called an enemy of Eritrean independence.
Instead, they were tied up in self-destruction and ironically bargaining and even seeking
an alliance with their so-called occupiers or colonizers under the auspices of the former
Soviet Union and East Germany. In the early 1975 and from a stronger bargaining
position, the ELF had proposed a union with the EPLF, believing that it could harness
and integrate the then smaller EPLF. The EPLF rejected union and demanded only an
alliance or united front whereby both organizations retained their separate identity and
independence. As of 1979, the balance of power had shifted in favour of the EPLF when
a large number of Eritrean youth, provoked by aggressive treatment by the Dergue, had
flocked to it. In a new twist of events, the EPLF adopted the policy of union it rejected
earlier – a union based on its analysis that the Eritrean field could not accommodate more
than one army. The EPLF thus indicated its plan to dominate the Eritrean scene either
through ‘voluntary’ union on its own terms or by using the firepower it now possessed.
To accomplish this strategy, alliance with the TPLF was crucial for the EPLF.
Towards the end of the 1970s and at the beginning of the 1980s with the Dergue
securing the full backing of the entire Eastern Bloc, political events in Ethiopia and
Eritrea were changing swiftly, and the TPLF and the EPLF were being cornered on
different fronts and needed each other more than ever before. One was looking for
266support from the other in exchange for what it could offer. The TPLF could provide the
EPLF with a much-needed army in its military engagement against offensives by the
Ethiopian regime and could also enter into an alliance against the ELF, as mentioned
earlier. It could also provide access to the Eritrean community in Tigrai, which the EPLF
badly needed, in order to find recruits and economic support. In a planned venture, the
TPLF then cooperated with the EPLF in recruiting young Eritreans in Tigrai and opening
the border areas for the EPLF army. The TPLF itself was in dire need of armaments,
ammunition and training assistance in the short term, and diplomatic support in the long
run. It had also had enough of ELF’s aggression and one way or another wanted to
resolve its conflict with it. In all these aspects, the EPLF now showed a readiness to
cooperate with the TPLF.
Unprecedented warm relations and cooperation between the two organizations
began in all fields – propaganda, joint military operations, the exchange of information
and material, and diplomacy. The EPLF trained and armed thousands of TPLF recruits in
its training facilities in Sahil and also instructed its offices abroad to cooperate with TPLF
functionaries or even agitate on behalf of the TPLF if cadres of the latter were not
available. EPLF’s bureaus abroad became stepping stones for TPLF diplomatic missions.
The TPLF reciprocated by fighting alongside the EPLF on the Eritrean war fronts. In
1979, when the EPLF decided to chase the ELF out of Eritrea once and for all, it asked
the TPLF if it would form a military alliance. Agreeing to the EPLF military blueprint,
instantly sanctioned in early 1980, the two organizations launched an all-out offensive
against the ELF. The ELF fled to Sudanese border and disintegrated.
In 1982, the Dergue unleashed one of its biggest military offensives – known as
the Red Star Campaign – against the EPLF. It targeted the EPLF base area of Sahil and so
the EPLF turned to the TPLF. The TPLF responded positively to the EPLF request for
military assistance in the Red Star offensive, not just for its own sake but also for its own
survival and to curb the Dergue’s campaign before it would roll into Tigrai. With such
pressing concerns, the TPLF in that year sent a contingent of three brigades to the EPLF
trenches in Sahil. The assistance of the TPLF fighting forces was critical to the EPLF in
267its fight for survival and the Dergue’s offensive was subsequently foiled. That trial of
strength and endurance, coupled with Ethiopian leader Mengistu’s mistaken desire to
‘command the last push’ himself, marked the turning point in the government offensive.
Without the assistance of the TPLF, this would not have happened and perhaps the fate of
the EPLF – and that of the TPLF for that matter – would have been uncertain. In any
case, both fronts would have been forced to adopt the guerrilla tactics of the early days.
This warm cooperation between the TPLF and the EPLF seemed promising, but
this would change as differences in military strategy resurfaced and ideological divisions
came to the fore. Differing points of view on the nature of the Soviet Union, the question
of nationality, and the military strategy to be applied for combating the Dergue were the
most significant points of enduring disagreement. The EPLF believed the Soviet Union’s
Communist Party (CPSU) to be a genuine party and it saw the Soviet Union as a socialist
state, arguing that domestic relations were socialist and there was no exploitation. The
Soviet Union’s intervention in the Horn of Africa was an isolated misguided foreign
policy that could be rectified any time. In general, according to the EPLF, the Soviet
Union was a strategic ally of oppressed peoples throughout the world. The TPLF, on the
other hand, argued that, after Joseph Stalin, the CPSU had become a revisionist party and
the Soviet Union was no longer a socialist state. Instead it had become an imperialist
power that oppressed and exploited common people everywhere it set foot.
Fundamentally similar to US-led western imperialism, it was in their view a dictatorship
of state capitalists that had to be dislodged from its autocratic position by the cooperation
of the working classes in every country. For the TPLF, the only truly socialist country at
the time was Enver Hoxha’s Albania. On this issue, the gap between the TPLF and the
EPLF was wide, but the EPLF preferred to downplay it by writing in their journal Adulis
(1985: 8), ‘For all these reasons, the ‘social imperialist’ nature of the Soviet Union should
not be a touchstone that divides Ethiopian organizations and the EPLF into two
antagonistic camps’.
On the question of nationalities, the difference was also great. Self-determination
of a nationality for the TPLF meant the inclusion of the right to secession. Even after
268becoming the government of Ethiopia, the TPLF, as a core element of the ruling EPRDF,
adhered to its secessionist stand (see Article 39 of the 1994 Ethiopian Constitution).
However, for the EPLF, ‘The demand for the secession of Ethiopian nationalities has
neither an historical nor an economic basis; nor is the extent of the prevailing national
antagonism so acutely sharp as to justify it’ (ibid.: 4). The details of this position were
broadcast on EPLF radio – Dimtsi Hafash - in January 1985 on three consecutive days, to
which the TPLF responded in March 1985 in a twenty-two-page article under the
sarcastic headline ‘Abi Zila Nikidmit’ (Great Leap Forward). In it, the TPLF openly but
bitterly criticized the position of the EPLF, as if they had been enemies throughout.
On the military front, the EPLF pursued positional warfare. Before 1977, it had
used mixed strategies of positional, mobile and guerrilla warfare but after the Dergue’s
military offensive in 1979, the EPLF army was pinned down in its trenches in the Sahil
region of northern Eritrea. Guerrilla and mobile operational warfare was abandoned. The
TPLF saw the EPLF’s military strategy as fatal to the Eritrean movement. The Ethiopian
military regime, having much greater human and material resources under its control,
could drain the strength of the Front in positional warfare. The TPLF argued that the
confinement of the EPLF to the trenches weakened its ability to mobilize the people and
adopt a flexible military strategy appropriate for the struggle. It argued that the EPLF
should abandon its positional warfare and, to compensate its shortage of human and
material resources, should adopt a mobile strategy of challenging the stronger enemy.
However, these differences were not by themselves the only cause of bad relations
and confrontations. The stronger and more experienced EPLF had always expected to
impose its will on the younger and less-experienced TPLF, although the latter would not
move from its organizational position. This attitude, which provoked and kept alive an
uneasy relationship between the two fronts, had already emerged in meetings of both
leaderships but since they were badly in need of one another in the face of a common
enemy, they suppressed their inimical attitudes and continued to work together. By this
stage, the TPLF had developed a large army that would play a critical role in major
engagements, such as foiling the Dergue’s Red Star Campaign. A development on the
269other side was the establishment by the TPLF of the Marxist-Leninist League of Tigrai
(MLLT) (see Chapter 8). This led to TPLF talking about its ‘superior’ ideology. It now
became obvious that the confrontation was between the elites of the two fronts that both
wanted to dominate the political scene and clear their way to power, as events
subsequently proved. It was, however, the leaders of the MLLT who appeared to be more
provocative than the elites on the other side, as evident from the former beginning to
publish polemic articles and generate unrest. They later even released one (in November
1986 in Tigrigna), under the title ‘Afelalayatna ab Giltsi Medrek Yekreb’ (Let Our
Differences be Public). In their drive to put the TPLF under party control, the founders of
the MLLT had begun to question all the organization’s existing positions and
achievements, including its relations with the EPLF. The motive appeared to be to
undermine the then TPLF leadership and provide an alternative.
The organizers of the MLLT were also sowing discord among TPLF and EPLF
fighters. They instructed the TPLF’s political commissars in the EPLF trenches in Sahil
to discuss the differences between the two organizations. Except on matters of military
strategy, the additional political and ideological rhetoric had no bearing on the struggle
and was irrelevant to the ordinary fighting force and the people. Since the fighters in
neither organization had the right to form and express their own opinion, the discussions
instigated had nothing to do with enlightenment. Fighters in both fronts were simply
supposed to reiterate what they were told by their respective ideologues. Deviation from
this norm was fatal. Thus the confrontation was spreading from top to bottom, with each
side mobilizing its fighters for its own opportunistic cause.
In these tense circumstances, the withdrawal of the TPLF contingent from the
Eritrean trenches was completed by the beginning of 1985. It was a grim time and
probably a blow to EPLF morale, since it now had to withstand other Dergue onslaughts
without the help of the TPLF army. Months later, the EPLF retaliated in a series of harsh
measures that infuriated not only the TPLF but also many Tigraians:92 it blocked the
TPLF’s only outlet to Sudan through western Eritrea in June 1985, at the time when
92 Tesfay Atsbaha, interview, 25 March 2004
270drought was affecting most of Tigrai and thousands were dying of starvation. This route
was the only one used by the TPLF and international aid organizations for deliveries of
humanitarian aid to the famine-stricken Tigrai region. The EPLF also unexpectedly
closed the popular Dimtsi Woyyane (Voice of Revolution), a TPLF radio station
operating from EPLF territory in Sahil. These measures were too harsh and too obvious
to hide from the public, as had been the practice of the TPLF with questionable measures
in previous years. This time, the subtlety of downplaying serious public issues, especially
in the eyes of the people whose sons and daughters were suffering to defend the
frontlines of the EPLF, did not work and from then on the TPLF was forced to exercise
self-reliance in everything it did. It soon mobilized peasants in their tens of thousands to
build a road to Sudan and in just three months an alternative route through the rough
terrain of Wolkait, southwest of Eritrea, was opened.
In mid-1985, the leaderships of the two organizations held a meeting, ostensibly to
discuss and solve their differences. However, they never came up with a solution to the
key differences and merely agreed to inform their fighters about the differences, which
was a recipe for further confrontation. Both fronts continued their propaganda campaigns
against each other in publications and public gatherings. The TPLF/MLLT went further
and appealed to the Eritrean people to reject the EPLF’s path of struggle, which it thought
would end up in betraying Eritrean independence. It declared:
‘These ordinary liberation organizations [EPLF and ELF] could not bring the
right solution to the complex situation. They have created a situation
whereby the Eritrean people could not mobilize itself to carry on the struggle.
… Therefore, by getting rid of these obstacles, and to establish a new
people’s Eritrea, it is compelling to create a capable organization, which
could give scientific leadership’, (TPLF 1979 EC [= 1986]: 289-91).
This declaration was accompanied by a book of 151 pages entitled Biret hizbi Eritrea
kulkul Afu Ayidefaen (Never Will the Gun of the Eritrean People Hang Down) published
271in 1986; it argued that only the gun would solve the Eritrean national (independence)
question. This was also in response to the Eritrean scholar Tesfatsion Medhanie who, in
his book Eritrea: Dynamics of a National Question (1986), had proposed a peaceful
resolution of the Ethio-Eritrean conflict.
In 1986 also, a booklet entitled Ye-Eritrea Hizb Tigil - Keyet Wediet (The Eritrean
People’s Struggle – From Where to Where, 1979 E.C.) was prepared by the TPLF/MLLT
to motivate people to form a ‘truly democratic’, ‘scientific’ and ‘capable’ organization
that could lead to the independence of Eritrea. ELF splinter groups, such as Sagem and
the Democratic Movement for Liberation of Eritrea (DMLE), were offered generous
material support in a bid to form an alternative Eritrean organization that would replace
the EPLF and could cooperate with the TPLF/MLLT. The TPLF/MLLT leadership went
too far in their relations with the EPLF by inviting the latter to open and confrontational
ideological debate.
The embittered relations and erratic confrontation between the TPLF and the
EPLF lasted for about four years (1985-1988). Had the Dergue refrained from exerting
military pressure, it is likely that they would have gone to war against each other, as
happened later in 1998. Their hostility was a blessing in disguise for the Dergue, which
gained time. Amicable cooperation not only could have brought down the Dergue sooner,
but could also have led to more fraternal cooperation between the two peoples who might
have rekindled historical relations. Knowingly or unknowingly, they were also the source
of additional misery for the two peoples, caught between at least three rival warring
factions. In this chaotic situation, the MLLT became the ideological vanguard of the
TPLF and came to control further political developments in the region. The EPLF
meanwhile prevailed in the whole of Eritrea.
Towards 1988, as the Dergue’s strength began to subside rapidly and the road to
power became apparent, the two fronts set their ideological rhetoric aside, at least
temporarily, dropping all propaganda attacks and accusations against each other. As
Gilkes and Plaut (1999: 10) put it, ‘Despite this rupture, the imperatives of war continued
to drive the two movements back into each other’s arms’. The TPLF and the EPLF
272resumed relations following a four-day meeting in Khartoum and issued a joint
communiqué in April 1988 that they would fight the Dergue together. Once again
relations between the two fronts warmed, as if past confrontations had not led them to the
brink of war. They began to hail their renewed relationship not out of principle or
sincerity but ‘…basically because of the dictates of military realities in the face of a
common enemy and with the operative logic of ‘an enemy’s enemy is my friend’’
(Aregawi, 2000: 117). The question, however, as to what would happen to both Fronts
when that common enemy would have gone remained unanswered. The pattern has
prevailed to this day.
Ethiopia and Eritrea under the TPLF and the EPLF Respectively
As the Dergue was gradually losing ground, for the TPLF and the EPLF, the bells of
victory were ringing, thanks to the thousands of young fighters who had committed their
lives to the struggle for change. The alliance forged in 1988 looked as though it would
hold at least for the near future. Optimistically, they began to launch joint operations
under a joint command. The Dergue faced multiple defeats and their strategic initiative
seemed to have gone.
After a series of joint campaigns, in May 1991, both armies marched on Addis
Ababa and Asmara respectively and removed the ruling regime from power. A small
EPLF contingent also joined the TPLF on its march to Addis. The EPLF formed the
Eritrean Provisional Government in Asmara and the TPLF, together with the junior
partners that formed the EPRDF,93 namely the Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement
(EPDM), the Oromo People’s Democratic Organization (OPDO), the Southern People’s
Democratic Organization and the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), which was not part of
the EPRDF, formed the Transitional Government of Ethiopia in Addis Ababa. The
93 The junior partners were formed by the support and guidance of the TPLF basically in the
interest of the later that badly needed the multi-national image to execute its agenda in Ethiopia.
273former fronts became new governments in their respective domains and assumed
different political responsibilities. Now they were confronted with the challenging reality
of delivering what they had been promising during the years of struggle – democracy,
freedom, rule of law, peace, progress, etc. But concern no. 1 was to retain and solidify
their power, which came from the ‘barrel of the gun’, and was to be maintained by the
same means. The EPLF and TPLF signed military accords, after which secretive and
dubious cooperation between them continued on the state level.
A study of the pragmatic and sometimes opportunistic relations established during
the armed struggle that continued after the two Fronts seized state power in Addis and
Asmara in May 1991 would be worthwhile, but the history of their relationship after this
juncture falls outside the scope of this thesis. However, it can be said that many problems
of the region toady are rooted in the immediately past and the events described here.
After the take-over of power in 1991, neither the TPLF nor the EPLF were
democratic and both lacked the confidence to accommodate other well-known political
forces that had fought against the Dergue. It led them to a systematic effort to rule alone,
co-opting others, ignoring the civil society forces in their respective countries and
denying them a space to operate. They neither sufficiently trusted their own people nor
allowed them to exercise basic rights freely or work with similar national organizations.
The TPLF after May 1991 began to dismantle all institutions of state power across
Ethiopia, which had never been its political domain during the struggle, as its strategic
objective was exclusively defined as self-determination for Tigrai. It relied on its
Tigraian guerrilla army and its alliance with the EPLF to settle in power and to stabilize
the Ethiopian political arena. To that end, the TPLF also had to appease the demands of
the EPLF, which extended from the political to the economic domain.94
94 It is interesting to note that the two organizations (TPLF and EPLF) possessed huge amounts of capital
that had been amassed partly from the contributions of the people to the struggle and partly from
humanitarian aid consigned to famine-stricken population in both areas. As a result of this accumulated
wealth, the investment and business firms of the two organizations came to dominate the economic
activities of their respective countries, but still the unfair relationship put the Ethiopian economy at a
disadvantage. Individual investors found it an uphill struggle to compete with organizations that had state
protection and enjoyed tariff and tax exemptions. The Eritrean business community and above all, the
274Due to its heavy-handedness, the EPLF created opposition in Eritrea and made the road
ahead tough for itself. Splinter groups of the former rival ELF emerged in the western
lowlands, adjacent to Sudan, to fight it. These regrouping fighters had longstanding ties
with the Muslim communities in the lowlands and with part of the Christians in the
highlands of Eritrea.
Because of the volatile circumstances both fronts had to face, they were forced, as
in the past, to turn to each other for help. Once again, relations between the two
organizations became deeply interlinked in the interests of survival and continuity. They
were also confronted by an as-yet-unresolved political crisis triggered by the sensitive
process of the secession of Eritrea from Ethiopia and the related border issue, the
consequences of which have been with us ever since.
Eritrea separated from Ethiopia politically in 1991 but in terms of trade, currency
and overall socio-economic activities it remained united with Ethiopia. Generally, the
following years showed that the two economies were intrinsically connected. The
impotence of party leaders in resolving their differences amicably and the dominance of
party economic investments over individual entrepreneurship are responsible not only for
the deep all-round crisis the people are facing but also for the fratricidal wars that took
tens of thousands of lives. The cause of the wars was presented as a ‘defence of territorial
integrity’ because this was the easiest way to mobilize the people, but this broad and
often vague claim is undermining, if not hindering, talks on relevant issues and
prolonging the conflict.
EPLF business empire, transferred a huge fortune from Ethiopia for domestic consumption and exports
from which Ethiopia could have benefited for its growth. The EPLF had been running a currency market
in Asmara and had been exchanging the common currency, the Ethiopian birr, for the US dollar at 1 to 7
while the official exchange rate at the time was at most 1 to 5.
275Summary
At first, common historical background and cultural affinities that existed before the
formation of Eritrea in 1980 by the Italian colonial power coupled with the presence of a
common enemy, the Ethiopian military regime, seemed to have brought the Tigraian and
Eritrean fronts closer together. In the face of those realities, a smooth relationship was
expected to prevail between the political elites of both. Yet, it soon became clear that
respective political elites had their own separate perceptions of alliance, methods of
struggle and unique political objectives that were largely associated with a specific
nationalist awareness that in turn influenced their future relations.
The rivalry between the Eritrean fronts, ELF and EPLF, where each had always
felt the need for ally in the nearby regions of Ethiopia, had its own bearing on the relation
and stand of the TPLF towards both Fronts. Eventually, the TPLF began to go well with
the EPLF until finally the ELF was swept away from its base areas by the combined
forces of both the EPLF and the TPLF. Moreover, both the TPLF and the EPLF jointly
confronted the forces of the Dergue government and achieved spectacular victories. Yet,
the unity based on military purpose was interrupted many times, as interaction on other
matters went wrong and hardly anything substantive was achieved on a joint political
front. It was the existence of a stronger enemy though that necessitated the revival of
their relations each time after a crisis, and finally they managed to coordinate their forces
to overthrow the Dergue. After their victory, their alliance came to a dead end and both
forces went to war again. As facts on the ground indicated and although a host of
immediate factors could be considered, the competition of the established authoritarian
political elites on both sides of the Mereb River for regional hegemony and access
economic resources was the root cause of enduring tensions and war. This chapter has
shown that this pattern of underlying tensions emerged in the course of the formative
struggle of the TPLF and the EPLF in the 1970 and 1980s, marked by the particular form
of elite politics of vanguard parties.
276Chapter 10
Consolidation of the TPLF: Forging Power through Social Change
Introduction
‘Let the masses be conscious, organized and armed’ became the TPLF’s motto95 after it
had defeated its rival fronts (the TLF, the EDU and the EPRP) in rural Tigrai, and the
battlefield was clear for direct confrontation with the ruling Dergue. Before engaging in
the decisive battles though, the TPLF considered it crucial to regiment the region’s
people into a manageable setting so that they would adhere to the political discipline
required in circumstances of war. After all, the TPLF depended solely on the people for
human and material resources to support its costly war project against a regime that had
the backing of the Soviet Union. With the Front’s seemingly good intentions and the
hope that the war would bring an end to their misery, the people had no other option but
to adhere to the TPLF’s projected aims sine qua non. This chapter considers the
processes by which the TPLF managed to muster and direct the people in its war efforts
that brought down the Dergue. It also examines the social-revolutionary measures
introduced, ostensibly to transform local society from feudalist bondage, thereby creating
a situation of ‘movement hegemony’.
95 This motto was conducted in a form of campaign that involved most of the TPLF departments
and mass associations. It was, to some extent, of a similar kind as the Cultural Revolution of
China. After this campaign the TPLF affirmed its prevalence in rural Tigrai.
277Peasant Associations
Two fundamental considerations shaped the TPLF’s mobilization and organizational
policies. Firstly, the TPLF wanted to isolate Tigrai from the regime and the multinational
movements operating within Tigrai. As an organization fighting for the right to self-
determination for the people of Tigrai, the TPLF saw it as imperative to claim and realize
a power monopoly in Tigrai. From the beginning, the TPLF claimed to be the vanguard or
true representative of the people of Tigrai. This stand was a basis for creating relations
with other Ethiopian multinational movements. Initial discussions with the EPRP in early
1976 collapsed among other things due to the TPLF claim that it was the sole legitimate
representative of the people of Tigrai and that the EPRP must endorse this claim if it
wanted to operate in Tigrai in a manner that would not jeopardize the TPLF as self-
proclaimed vanguard of the Tigraian struggle for self-determination..
In the second half of the 1970s, as described earlier, there were rival organizations
in Tigrai competing with the TPLF that wanted to establish primacy. None of the fronts
(the TPLF, the EPLF or the EPRP) then had been able to impose their will on the people
and each was afraid that the rival organization would exploit dissatisfaction. In the
districts of Agame and Adwa, where the TPLF and the EPRP operated side by side, and
in Shire, where the TPLF and the EDU operated in a confrontational manner, the people
felt relatively free to express their opinions and reject policies that they believed did not
serve their interests. For the people, the presence of competing organizations at the time
was a blessing in disguise, but it aroused the indignation of the TPLF, which worked
towards forced retreat of the other organizations.
Secondly, after having seen the Chinese and Vietnamese experiences, the TPLF
wanted to organize the people in order to be able to mobilize and control them.
Experience was gained from studying these revolutions and other countries where
protracted armed struggle showed the importance of mass organization in the
mobilization of the people and the creation of mechanisms to control and suppress
deviants, who were considered to be serving the enemy (the Dergue) or rival forces. The
278insurgent war required, as they saw it, a predictable and passive home front following the
vanguard.
At the early stages of the struggle, neither the TPLF nor the EDU or the EPRP
were able to call for compulsory meetings of the people. They, instead, used to go to
places where people gathered freely for social purposes, such as churches, burial
ceremonies, market places and sometimes neighbourhood meetings, and used these as a
forum to explain their goals. Force was never used in these gatherings. Persuasion was
the only acceptable method to direct people - as the TPLF and the EPRP had to respect
the rights of the people to be administered by the organization of their choice.
During the first one or two formative years, the TPLF was unable to attract
sufficient young men and women to enlist in its army. The shimagles (or elders), who
traditionally speak for the community, approved the TPLF’s conduct and the discipline of
its army but they cautioned their sons and daughters against its propaganda. Through
songs and by way of informal discussions, the TPLF cadres presented themselves as the
legitimate sons and daughters of Tigrai, claiming that the other fronts did not belong
there. As an oral genre, Wodi-Tigrai (literally, the ‘son of Tigrai’) was used by the TPLF
rank and file as the rhetoric formula in its daily encounters with rival elements. The
others reciprocated by accusing the TPLF of fostering ‘narrow nationalist sentiments’ in
its members, which was in a way happening, although the others too had their own
domineering attitudes.
As the TPLF had no external relationships to generate support, it was totally
dependent on the local population for human and material resources, more so than the
EDU and the EPRP. The latter two were receiving substantial external support in addition
to what they earned from the local population. On top of that, or because of it, the TPLF
had to bear the extra burden of mobilizing the people of Tigrai against the state and all
the forces that seemed to stand against the self-determination and who leaned towards a
strict unitary view of Ethiopia. The TPLF worked hard to prove its slogan ‘Vanguard of
the Tigrai nation’ by developing populist mobilization rhetoric. The struggle to resolve
the impasse was complicated by the presence of the EDU and the EPRP in Tigrai. It was,
279however, during this brief and tumultuous period of competing forces that the people
experienced relative freedom of expression and the right to support a front of their choice
– a relative freedom which later vanished with the TPLF’s domination in the military and
political fields. As explained in Chapter 5, the TPLF removed the TLF, EDU and the
EPRP from Tigrai between 1975 and 1978 and became the only force in Tigrai opposing
the Dergue. The line of confrontation in Tigrai came to be between absolute unity, as
hailed by the Dergue, and self-determination, represented by the TPLF, with lip-service
to unity.
The victory of the Ethiopian armed forces over the invading Somali army in 1978
had given the regime respite to mobilize its forces against the movements in the north.
Land reform, the successful repulsion of the invading Somali army from Ethiopian
territories, and the organization and arming of the people in the towns and cities as well
as in most parts of the central region in the South enabled the Dergue to wipe out the
democratic movements in the centre and muster forces to confront the insurgent
movements in the north.
The consolidation of the Dergue denied the TPLF its material and human
resources in the cities and towns of Ethiopia. The flow of new recruits and the trickle of
material support from the urban areas to the TPLF dramatically slowed down. On top of
this, the TPLF lost many of its combatants in fighting with the EDU, EPRP and the
regime. At the same time, the TPLF had to fill the vacuum created by the removal of the
EDU and the EPRP. A combination of uphill undertakings made the struggle of the Front
very difficult, and the wars and the hard living conditions even caused desertions among
TPLF members to the Dergue camp. It desperately needed new recruits to replenish its
army and guarantee their continuous flow in the future. The TPLF was to place the
burden on the peasant society.
On the other hand, the removal of the rival organizations, the EDU and EPRP
from Tigrai created two important conditions for the consolidation of the TPLF. Firstly,
EPRP’s and EDU’s absence terminated TPLF (potential) members’ exposure to the
propaganda of these multinational movements. The crack in the TPLF’s CC that appeared
280in 1976 on the Tigraian national question remained perhaps because of the fact that the
monopolization of power in Tigrai by the TPLF satisfied the secessionist elements in the
leadership who wrote the 1976 manifesto. They believed that controlling the people was a
step in the right direction and that it strengthened their aspirations. The immediate task
therefore became the mobilization of the people for the TPLF cause, which in a way did
not contradict their sectarian, if not secessionist project.
Secondly, the confrontation in Tigrai became one between the TPLF and the
Dergue regime alone. People in Tigrai outside the regime’s control lost the right of
choice that they had enjoyed when other organizations operated in Tigrai too. Following
this development, the TPLF launched a massive campaign with the aim of ‘agitating,
organizing and arming the people’. With the motto of ‘liberation’, it became easier and
more expedient for the TPLF to coerce the people and put them in the respective
organizational blueprints provided by the movement, most of which were reproduced or
copied from like-minded liberation fronts or regimes with a similar ideology.
People’s associations that had been previously constituted in some form by the
EDU and the EPRP were taken over by the TPLF. A series of gämgams (evaluation
procedures) were carried out to weed out or suppress EDU and EPRP sympathizers.
Large meetings were organized with the aim of exposing those who sympathized with the
EDU and the EPRP and assessing the depth of their involvement in these organizations.
Such procedures of scrutiny went on until 1991. There was an atmosphere of terror for
the individuals concerned because their relations with the EDU or the EPRP were made
public. Fighters from all the organizations frequently used to visit peasants and spend the
night in their houses either to politicize them or to seek food and accommodation. For
many individuals, the safer way was to make the necessary ‘self-criticisms’ and redefine
their allegiance even if they did not like it. For others, silence seemed the better choice
and they remained undetected, keeping their original views.
The second part of the gämgam process was criticism. The chairing cadre or any
TPLF sympathizer could direct his criticism against anyone suspected of being a
supporter or a member of the EDU or the EPRP. The accused had little chance to defend
281him/herself. Arguing that s/he had done no wrong being an EDU or EPRP sympathizer
was tantamount to admitting a grave mistake. The fate of those who denied their
connection to the EDU or the EPRP lay in the hands of the TPLF – they could be set free
or sent to prison for further interrogation.
The TPLF-liberated/controlled areas also underwent sweeping changes in social
mechanisms or procedures introduced by the Front to organize and control the people.
The project of ‘agitate, organize and arm the people’ was meant for this purpose, and
trained cadres (kifli hizbi) were placed in every liberated woreda (district) to carry out
this revolutionary project. Persuasion was replaced by disguised coercion in the name of
‘the revolutionary duty for the struggle’. The TPLF organized countless meetings and
seminars to convince at least some of the people and in order to impose the will of the
movement. The people did not have the right to choose the agenda or pass a decision
against the will of the Front. From the beginning, there were people committed to the
cause of the TPLF but there were still many others who for one reason or another did not
establish close relations with it. Their motives for cooperation could be political
conviction, their loved ones being in the Front or because they had benefited in some way
from the presence of the TPLF. The TPLF used these persons as a stepping stone to
organizing the people in various manageable associations and to mobilize them for the
war effort.
A policy of organizing the people according to profession, sex and age became
compulsory. Peasants were ordered to gather and form a ‘mass association’, membership
of which was obligatory for all peasants in the locality concerned. The constitution was
prepared by the TPLF and presented for discussion and adoption as the constitution of the
association. Election of CC members to the association finalized the process.
The largest and politically the most important associations were the peasant
associations. All adult peasants, including women and the upper sections of the youth
(young families), were obliged to enlist. With the growth of the TPLF, the consolidation
of the mass associations and the subsequent baitos (people’s council), persuasion was
gradually replaced by orders and coercion.
282The peasant associations became a mechanism for control and mobilization of the
people for the armed struggle. They performed civil administration according to TPLF
guidelines, with direct supervision by the kifli hizbi. In every tabia (village) in the
liberated areas there was also a tabia baito with all its committees. The baitos confirmed
all the laws and directives presented to them by the TPLF. The TPLF mobilized the
peasant associations as well as other associations to secure confirmation of the rules and
regulations and their application by the baito organs.
In Tigrai, as tradition dictated, the community elders (shimagle) speak for the
entire community. The status of shimagle was an individual’s achievement. People with
wisdom, integrity, honesty and impartiality were accepted as shimagles in the community
and they had a broad role, from settling family and community disputes to resolving
armed conflicts. Some shimagles had tried to mediate between the TPLF and the regime
or the EDU and the EPRP. In the face of such an experienced and deeply rooted
institution, it was difficult for the TPLF to steer the peasantry at will. The formation of
the peasant associations included young adults and women who were at the same time
members in the youth and women’s associations, as well as the shigweyenti (peasant
cadres), who were members of their respective association and became a force against the
shimagles. The roles of the shimagles were gradually undermined by these new
structures, to which the shimagles rarely belonged. The traditional institution of
shimagles which had been effectively mediating between forces in conflict thus had to
give way to the new revolutionary arrangements.
Land Reform
The land-holding system in Tigrai differed in many ways from that in other parts of
Ethiopia, where peasants had often been denied possession of their land and where past
emperors had granted large expanses of land to their active and retired officials and
soldiers for their service to them and the country. Peasants often had a status near to serfs.
283As in feudalist systems elsewhere, big landlords, most of whom were absentee owners
and not native to the region, demanded from a half to three-quarters of their peasants’
annual produce. The landowners together with the assimilated native landlords formed
and consolidated what became known in the South as the neftegna (warrior, gun bearer)
settler stratum and the economic basis of the ruling elite of Ethiopia
In Tigrai, a historic heartland of the Ethiopian state, it was different. Traditionally
and until the emergence of movements like the TPLF, there had been two types of land-
holding system in Tigrai. One was the risti system, in which every Tigraian was entitled
to a piece of land by virtue of his/her descent from a common ancestor. Risti landholders
had the right to pass on their land to their offspring. This land-holding system led to
endless fragmentation of the land in northern Ethiopia, and the subsequent division and
redistribution of land among heirs led to complex land disputes (cf. Bauer 1985). Parcels
of land became smaller and more spread out and land became fragmented to the point
that it decreased in productivity because of its size and scattered position.
Moreover, land inheritance brought about litigation over claims and counter-
claims concerning land. Land disputes were expensive and time-consuming, with those in
government and church positions and rich people being the main beneficiaries, while the
peasants were often disadvantaged and found themselves destitute. Those claimants who
were in government positions in the urban areas were able to amass more land than their
kin. Like the feudal lords, the church also possessed large tracts of land known as risti-
gulti,96 a system that excluded many migrant newcomers and minorities. A fair
distribution of land under the risti system did not appear possible without changing entire
the system of ownership. Putting an end to this system was a popular demand in Tigrai.
Unlike the risti system, the second land-holding system, known as deisaa
(community ownership), was based not on blood relations or descent from the common
forefathers of the community, but on membership in the local (territorial) community
and taking part in community obligations. Every member had the right to a piece of
96 ‘As the theoretical owner of all land, the emperor assigned gults or fiefs to worthy followers’
(Marcus, 1994: 19), the Church as an observant ally included.
284land by virtue of his/her membership of the community. Land was not inheritable in this
system and when a landholder left the community or died his/her land went back to
community ownership and would be available for redistribution.
Land in the deisaa system was redistributed at regular intervals, usually every
seven years, to accommodate the needs of young families and newcomers to the
community, who often suffered due to delays in redistribution. People in positions of
power and influence amassed large areas of fertile land through bribes and promises of
money lending for poor peasants. The deisaa land-holding system began to lose its
initial egalitarian character and gradually fell into the hands of the powerful who
managed to control the best land at the expense of others.
Land under the rist and deisaa systems could not be sold or transferred. Land for
Tigraians was not only an economic asset but also a sign of status and a defining
parameter of one’s identity. It was a ‘birth certificate’ for an individual and testified to
his/her birth in the area. Therefore, in theory if not in practice there were only few
landless peasants and absentee landlords in Tigrai. The state and the church, which
claimed a third of the land each, did not abuse ownership of rist and deisaa land. Riste-
gulti rights were simply imposed on the general rist and deisa rights.
Emperors and their officials used to grant land as gulti to officials and churches,
and especially to monasteries for their services and upkeep. Gulti rights did not bias rist
and deisaa rights. Gulti was also superimposed on risti and deisaa rights. Gulti was also
granted to servants of the state and the Emperors in lieu of salary and pension. The gulti
holder collected taxes on his gulti and passed part of it on to the state and retained the rest
for him/herself. Any gulti holder had the right to demand services and expect gifts from
the peasants on that land. This system was abolished in the 1960s by the late Emperor
Haile Selassie, but vestiges remained in isolated cases. Only church gulti existed at the
time of the collapse of the Emperor’s reign in 1974.
Many of the monasteries in Tigrai owned large gulti lands and the church was
entitled to part of the produce of the peasants who farmed the gulti land. A minimum of
20% of the peasants’ produce went to the gulti holder. The monks and nuns in the
285monasteries did not offer services directly to the peasants except their religious activities
as (perceived) guardians of the moral order and worldview, including prayers for good
harvests, peace and long life for the Emperors. The vast majority of the people on gulti
land probably did not even know where the gulti-holding monasteries were, let alone
benefit from the offerings they made. Every village had a parish church and priests, and a
few monasteries offered services in the villages in their immediate vicinity. Generally,
the peasants saw church gulti as simply unjust.
Unlike the monasteries, all parish churches were supported and maintained by the
community concerned. Each church had its hierarchical administration. The gabaz (the
administrator of the church) could be a priest or a layman and he would organize the
church land and other properties. In the countryside, the people allocated tracts of land
for the upkeep of the church and for the services of the priests. These particular sections
of land were called rim and were neither inheritable nor for sale. It was distributed among
priests in active service.
Tekeste Agazi (1983: 6) gives a general picture of land holding in Tigrai just
before the revolution:
…25% of the peasants had little or no land. Those who owned land had very
small holdings: 45% had less than a hectare, 23% between half and one
hectare and 21% between one and two hectares. A very small group of
people, usually those in positions of power, and the church, owned a great
deal of land. In addition 25% of the farmers were renting all or part of the
land they farmed, and sections of the Tigrean people had no land rights.
These included Moslems in certain awrajas, some women and immigrants.
In 1975 the Dergue proclaimed the nationalization of all land, thus implementing
the revolutionary student slogan ‘Land to the tiller’. This proclamation abolished
all church gulti rights and the peasantry on church gulti land understandably were
then no longer willing to continue to deliver part of their produce to the churches
286and monasteries. The monasteries thus lost their rights to their himsho (a fifth of
what was produced on the land) and absentee landlords lost their rights to the land
they claimed as risti.
Right after the military regime’s land proclamation, the peasants in Tigrai
wanted it to be implemented, and peasants in areas under Dergue control formed
committees that redistributed land. However, a few hours’ walk from the garrison
town of Adigrat, the EPRP also began to redistribute land, a development that
created substantial political pressure on the TPLF to move fast in implementing
land reform ostensibly to benefit the poor peasants. Later, the TPLF admitted that
people’s pressing demands for land reform, the Dergue’s attempts to mobilize the
people on the issues as well as the EPRP’s land reform efforts in its liberated areas
in Tigrai forced it to launch its own land reform, long before it had trained cadres
and made the necessary preparations for it (TPLF, September 1977 EC.: 9).
On this issue the TPLF stood, in principle, for the nationalization of land
but was lagging behind the Dergue and the EPRP in land-reform policy, but when
it did start land distribution, it is fair to say that it made it an instrument for
mobilizing people who otherwise would have rallied behind the EPRP or the
Dergue. Thus, land reform was hastily conducted by the TPLF: not primarily for
its own sake but to rally the people behind its war project. The TPLF justified such
a policy by rationalizing that the fate and long-term interests of the people
depended on the victory of the TPLF’s armed struggle.
Land distribution in the liberated areas was thus influenced by the need to
make available material and human resources. Firstly, land was granted to people
who lived in the liberated areas but were not engaged in farming and were not
expected to do so in the future. These people included manual workers, merchants,
prostitutes, sellers of homemade liquor, small retailers and goldsmiths. These
working-class people and craftsmen generally lived in the towns. Hired labour was
also tolerated. Land grants to these people were politically motivated, as these
groups would not have been eligible for land under the Dergue’s land policy. That
287privilege they owed to the TPLF and in return the TPLF demanded their loyalty
and their contributions in one form or the other.
Secondly, land was used to reward those who supported and contributed to the
armed struggle. It was initially declared that land would be divided among families
according to their size. For instance, students who went to school in the towns and cities
depended on their families, who could therefore claim land on their behalf. The TPLF
imposed political criteria to exclude those who were believed not to support the struggle.
Land clearly became an instrument for mobilization and surveillance of the people, and
access to land was, in effect, under the TPLF’s control.97
In many tabias (village units), land was put aside allegedly for communal use. The
people of the respective localities farmed the so-called communal land and passed on
produce to the TPLF. This produce from the communal land went either directly to the
TPLF or was used as provisions for TPLF-related conferences and congresses of the
associations and baitos. For example, in 1976 E.C., the peasants of Zana farmed 50
hectares of arable land and handed the produce over to the conference of the woreda
baito (TPLF September 1977 EC.: 179-80).
The abolition of the land-holding system of risti and deisaa certainly had popular
support among the people. The peasants hoped to avoid the expensive land disputes and
court cases of the risti system and the delays of redistribution in deisaa which affected
newcomers and young families. The TPLF slogan ‘The land belongs to the
community/people’ was understood by the peasants as communal ownership and not state
ownership. It should be noted, however, that in the early stages of the TPLF’s struggle,
i.e. before its consolidation, the land-reform process was carried out after obtaining the
partial consent of the people to distribute land and after the parameters for distribution
had been discussed in public. There were, therefore, different land-reform approaches and
97 This system of land control and using it as an instrument of mobilization and surveillance of the
people continued after the TPLF seized power in 1991 in the name of EPRDF. Article 40.3 of the
Ethiopian Constitution that was ratified in 1994 declared that, “The right to ownership of rural
and urban land, as well as all natural resources, is exclusively vested in the state and in the people
of Ethiopia. Land is a common property of the nations, nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia and
shall not be subject to sale or other means of transfer.”
288techniques in different tabias and woredas at different times. The TPLF could not impose
its land-reform policy due to a lack of power and concern about losing the confidence of
the people, who at the time had the option of switching their support for the regime in
power or the rival front EPRP.
Such an opportunistic and varied land-reform policy had drawbacks. Frequent
redistribution of land reduced the peasants’ motivation to care for it, and reduced
investment had consequences for the future land economy. Whether land reform led to an
increase in agricultural production is not clear, because recurring drought had left the
land dry and unproductive. Giday Zeratsion, the former TPLF CC member and the late
Meles Bezabih, the former TPLF official in charge of agricultural development in 1984
reported98 that the TPLF’s land reform did not lead to an increase in production, but
Sibhat Nega, the TPLF CC member in charge of the Socio-Economic Department,
disputed this allegation on theoretical grounds, arguing that peasants put more effort into
production if the land and the produce belonged to themselves than if they were only
tenants. According to Sibhat, the nationalized or state/front owned land belongs to the
peasants. He also claimed that an increase in production could have been realized had
there been no drought and accused Meles Bezabih of denigrating TPLF policies, for
which he was incriminated until he resigned from the organization.99
Agricultural development involved not only the change of hands of land based on
a fair redistribution but also the introduction of technological innovations, better methods
of farming and market opportunities. Without a comprehensive plan to address all the
variables associated with land reform, land distribution in itself would not bring about the
outcome the people had hoped for. The liberated territories in Tigrai were isolated from
the urban areas and the peasants therefore had no market possibilities. Farming methods
and equipment were archaic. The very limited veterinary services and rare credit
opportunities previously provided by the state were discontinued, and the TPLF was not

presence of author of this book.
99 Interview, Giday Zeratsion, Oslo, 16 March 2004.
289in a position to provide an alternative since its main preoccupation was the war effort
against the Dergue.
Both the drought and the war obviously had a negative influence on production,
but to put the blame solely on these factors, as the TPLF CC did in 1985 during the
MLLT founding congress, would be wrong. Firstly, the forms of tenancy, which did not
encourage farmers to work hard for limited years, were not abolished in the liberated
areas because land was granted to almost everyone, including those who were not
engaged in agriculture.100 Secondly, the fact that land was distributed and redistributed at
short intervals discouraged the peasants from investing in it. Since the peasants were
unsure whether the land would belong to them in the coming years and could not give it
the necessary care, its quality deteriorated. The influence of the TPLF land policy on
agricultural production was therefore minimal.
Land reform, however, indirectly helped produce a big number of fighters for the
armed struggle. Almost everyone in the liberated area had a claim to a plot of land, which
generated a sense of equality among the people. But to actually receive it and retain it
depended on the consent of the TPLF. It used land as a positive and negative incentive in
mobilizing people for the war project. Land and its management was thus a crucial link
between the people and the TPLF’s strategic aim.
Women`s Organization: A New Phenomenon
From the beginning, the TPLF recognized the importance of organized constituencies in
the protracted armed struggle. As a matter of principle, in the national struggle no social
group was to be ignored and each was expected to contribute something in the fight.
Women were seen as the most oppressed section of society in Tigrai and indeed their
oppression was multi-facet. During the initial period of the armed struggle, mobilizing
100 According to the report of the Foreign Relations Bureau of the TPLF (1979: 10), over 2.2
million Tigreans became ‘owners’ of land.
290and organizing them was difficult and slow. The first woman fighter, Kahsu (Martha),
joined the front some eight months after the struggle started. The male-dominated
cultural attitudes in Tigraian society that confined women to the house, coupled with the
nature of the guerrilla movement, hindered the TPLF from enlisting women fighters and
forming women’s associations.
But the need to mobilize women’s associations appeared when village elders –
together with the wives of militia men – exerted pressure on the militia to allow them to
reduce the amount of time they were expected to spend caring for their families. In
Tigrai, a parochial society, it was difficult to address women’s issues in public because
when the TPLF conducted propaganda work among assembled groups of people, the
women were either not there or could not express their opinions in the presence of their
spouses. The TPLF was thus forced to form separate forums for women to expose them
to its propaganda.
The few educated women fighters who had already joined the Front focused on
this problem. The male and female cadres of the TPLF in the mass mobilization bureau
gradually succeeded in organizing women at various levels, and the female fighters
became part of the peasant women’s community. In the beginning it was difficult for the
village women to even differentiate between male and female TPLF fighters as their
hairstyles, footwear and clothing were similar. The female cadres had to uncover part of
their clothing to show the peasant women that they too were women like them. They also
worked in the kitchens, fetched water, gathered firewood with the village women and
together attended local cultural ceremonies at which the Front’s political programme was
presented. As insiders, they were able to mobilize the women and, consequently, the
whole family and the community.
Another factor that facilitated entering the women’s domain was the monkish
behaviour of the TPLF fighters. Sexual contacts between the fighters and between
fighters and peasant women were prohibited. Sexual violence, which was rampant in this
semi-feudal society, was declared a crime punishable by death and from then on, peasant
women had no reason to fear offences such as rape by male fighters. Equally, the male
291peasants had no reason to question the faithfulness of their wives and daughters when
they lived and worked with male fighters. The confidence of peasant women in the male
fighters thus increased dramatically.
A growing enthusiasm emerged among the women about their new rights,
something that had previously been unheard of. They got the chance to discuss social
issues in public which had hitherto been a male domain. It was also new for women to
communicate with the authorities and present their own cases themselves. The presence
of the women cadres increased the confidence of the women in the community and the
communication between the people and the TPLF. In the past, women had been
represented in public places like courts by their husbands or male relatives and
acquaintances. Now, they could represent themselves in a real sense. Women became not
only entitled to seek justice on their own account but also to dispense it. Aregash Adane,
the female member of the TPLF’s CC confirmed that ‘In the baitos [people’s assemblies]
they share the activities on an equal basis with men. Their number is more than 30%
overall. This is good, considering the backwardness of the culture’ (quoted in Hammond
1989: 136). This achievement was a revolutionary step forward that uprooted the former
male chauvinist culture and the women were grateful to the TPLF for these new rights.
Some even composed songs of praise and encouraged entire communities to sing with
them. Youth and children saw their mothers’ attitudes towards the TPLF and followed
suit.
In addition, women were beneficiaries of the TPLF’s land policy. Unmarried or
widowed women received land and women were entitled to a half of the family’s land if
divorced. Land reform made them economically independent of their husbands and
marriage, which had previously been arranged by the family, became a voluntary
association. Women in the small towns who lived off retail trade, the sale of homemade
beverages and prostitution were all given land. Most of these women were victims of the
risti and deisaa land systems and, as women, it was difficult for them to claim and share
land in the old system. They had fled to the towns in the grim hope of being able to keep
their alive. The right to land under the TPLF land policy was more than an economic
292benefit for them: it was recognition of their human rights and made them equal to men.
They perceived this newly won right as the social justice they had been denied for so
long.
TPLF cadres organized political seminars for selected women at the tabia and
woreda level. Many of those who absorbed the political training were helpful in forming
and mobilizing women’s associations. As of the 1980s, these were set up in many of the
woredas. Women played a part in all community activities as administrators, judges and
assembly members. And as they became economically independent, their support for the
TPLF grew steadily. The TPLF women’s associations became a strong force in the
TPLF’s campaign to oppose early marriage for girls because it was women who had been
suffering in many ways from the widespread practice of child marriage in Tigrai.
The old system of socio-economic and gender suppression changed, and victims
could now hope for a better life. Family relations became more open and were based on a
free choice of partners and no economic subordination. These new liberties aroused
enthusiasm and many women became fulltime campaigners for the TPLF as their
participation in all fields of public life grew steadily.
With progress in the armed struggle, however, the rights and aspirations of
women in the liberated areas had to endure many ups and downs. As more and
more men were enlisted in the army, the number of marriages in the liberated
territories dropped dramatically. An article in the TPLF constitution that forbade
sexual relations between fighters and between fighters and the civilian community
was extended in the 1980s to include married spouses, if one or both of them was
a TPLF member. Those men who joined the TPLF leaving their wives and
children at home were not allowed to see their families. In this way, the TPLF
annulled all existing marital contracts between fighters and between the
community and fighters.
Many young women in the liberated areas were in a dilemma. Some wanted
to go to the urban areas to look for a better life, while others wanted to join the
TPLF army. But both options were unrealistic in the circumstances. The TPLF
293prohibited the movement of people, especially young women, to government-
occupied cities and towns but it could not accept all the women who wanted to
join the TPLF army. It argued that the army could not absorb everyone who
applied for enrolment without reducing its fighting capacity, a position that was
unacceptable to women in and outside the Front.
The mobilization of women was effected mainly by the TPLF women fighters.
They were over-represented in the cadres, the department responsible for the organization
of the masses. In 1983, the TPLF decided to place the women fighters in a separate
organization in order to tackle the growing dissatisfaction among women in the liberated
areas. It was supposed to take over formal leadership of the women’s associations. At that
time the women in the liberated areas were threatening to resort to demonstrations for
their rights and for equality. The new committee was chaired by Aregash Adane, a social
work graduate and then a CC member. The motive for organizing the women fighters in a
separate organization was to centralize the mass association of women in the liberated
areas.
In line with this, the TPLF also established two schools for women, called
‘Martha’ and ‘March 8’. The first was exclusively for female TPLF fighters, the second
was for women fighters and civilian women cadres in the Front’s mass associations. The
establishment of these schools in 1983 was part of the process of creating the Tigrai
Women’s Association under the control of the TPLF.
The project of bringing the women associations directly under the TPLF structure
was a reverse of a prior promise that the local mass association of women would be
organized on their own in zone, regional and higher levels and would remain
independent. The TPLF wanted to subordinate the women’s mass associations to the
direct control of the TPLF fighters’ association. This denied women their rights to an
independent association so it was an uphill struggle for women fighters like Aregash
Adane and the male fighters who supported their cause.
The TPLF leaders, especially after the take-over of the MLLT, argued that the rights of
women were achievable only after the victory of the ongoing revolution. All women’s
294activities had to be subordinated to the armed struggle and the congress passed a
resolution condemning feminism in the TPLF.
The extensive organizational network of women nevertheless became a formidable
force in the war against the regime. As of 1984, the women’s associations were put under
the WFA of the TPLF. Massive campaigns were set up to mobilize and control women in
the liberated areas. Women made up about a third of the TPLF army and hundreds of
female peasant cadres were engaged in organizing the people and mobilizing resources
for the army. The TPLF provided young women in the associations with texts for songs
that praised those young men who joined the TPLF and humiliated those who did not.
There were also attempts by the TPLF to train women to replace men in the
production process. Men and women peasants worked together on their farms as well as
at home. But there were special tasks exclusively for men and for women. Ploughing and
threshing remained the exclusive domain of men, while cooking was a task for the
women. The TPLF was worried about a possible decrease in agricultural production
because more and more young men were joining the TPLF. It therefore wanted to train
women to take over the male role of breadwinner in their families. But this was an
ambitious task, which required good planning and the technological support that would
replace the enormous burden the women had to shoulder both in the house and outside.
The project was abandoned because of the looming protests of the people.
The Youth: Cadres and Cultural Troupes
The TPLF’s first recruits were students and young civil servants from the towns and
cities, where Tigraian nationalism sprouted in the wake of the 1974 revolution. The
wanton measures of the Dergue regime contributed to this flow of youngsters. As Merera
Gudina (2002: 171) wrote: ‘The massive military repression, especially the unleashing of
the ‘Red Terror’, became the unintended catalyst to drive the Tigrayan youth to the TPLF
side’. The peasantry was not concerned with Tigrai’s relations with the rest of Ethiopia.
295There was only a small non-Tigraian minority living and working in Tigrai and there had
never been any conflict between Tigraians and those from outside Tigrai. Some of the
peasants who were trained by the EPLF dropped out immediately after they returned to
Tigrai.
Nevertheless, the TPLF was able to establish good relations with the people, based
on the respect the TPLF showed them, their liberation from local bandits by the TPLF
and the TPLF’s efforts to dispense justice in civil disputes, which had been rather
inaccessible and expensive for the people under preceding regimes. The people accepted
the TPLF mainly because in comparison with the situation under the previous regimes, it
made their lives more peaceful and had put an end to the shiftas who lived by plundering
them. However, there was little commitment by the people to the wider goals of the
TPLF, and the rural youth (as opposed to the urban youth which was inspired by
revolutionary ideals) showed limited interest in joining the TPLF, a situation that
continued until 1979.
In due course and for a number of different reasons, the TPLF began to face a
shortage of new recruits. The Dergue obtained political, diplomatic and, above all,
military support from the Soviet bloc and consolidated its power in the administrative
centres of the country. Fighting the Dergue appeared impossible for the peasant youth.
The major multinational opposition organizations lost hold in the cities and towns under
the impact of the Red Terror Campaign (1977-78). The flow of recruits from the towns to
the TPLF also declined and at the same time the TPLF lost many of its fighters in wars
against the EDU, the EPRP and the Dergue. The growth of the TPLF army slowed
markedly in 1978-1979.
In addition, the TPLF was emerging from its 1978 internal crisis, which the
leadership attributed to the ‘petty bourgeois nature’ of its rank and file. Many fighters
were implicated in the crisis, imprisoned and, in some cases, killed. A significant number
deserted, fearing for their lives. The TPLF desperately needed new sources of recruitment
and was only left with the option of mobilizing the peasant youth. The TPLF tried to
recruit as many peasants as possible to neutralize the student-dominated army and after
296the drastic decrease of the flow of new recruits from the towns, recruiting peasants
became a question of life and death for the TPLF. It thus launched a systematic campaign
to mobilize the youth to its cause.
Part of this was a new demographic policy. It pressed the baitos to increase the
allowed marriage age, which was accordingly raised as high as 26 for men and 22 for
women. In some tabias (villages, hamlets), marital status was the main criterion for
claiming land, while in others, age was one of the criteria. In effect, land determined
marriage because it was the main economic base to establishing a family. In tabias where
age was a criterion, young adults below the age level could not marry because they could
not support themselves and their families without land. Delaying marriage meant young
people had to wait longer to get land. The TPLF had ample opportunity to manipulate the
youth who were trying to get married and get land, or get land to get married. Family
responsibilities prevented men from staying away from their homes and their land for a
longer period of time. Fathers had to earn to support their families. But delaying marriage
left the young adult without a family to look after. The fact that young unmarried adults
did not own land meant they could not produce and save for the future. Thus, the young
adult was separated from family and land, their only means of production. These two
factors were the most important ones that tied Tigraian peasants to their home and their
land.
After isolating the youth from family and land, the TPLF launched a campaign of
organizing youth associations throughout the liberated areas. It was conducted in such a
way that resisting appeared tantamount to ‘betrayal of the nation of Tigrai’. The youth
associations became the instruments for engaging the youth in logistical tasks and
became the breeding ground and preparation for joining the TPLF’s army.
The TPLF used many instruments to attract the youth into joining the army or
even pressurize them to do so. One such instrument was the organization’s cultural
troupe, codenamed 01, which had special branches for the regions. The cultural troupe
toured the woredas and tabias to ‘agitate’ the youth and the cadres organized cultural
events for them. After each scene, one of the cadres called out a slogan such as ‘I shall
297fight for Tigrai’, ‘Let us stand for our rights’ and ‘I will join the TPLF army!’ The entire
group had to repeat it. This was interpreted as a declaration of intent to join the army. The
kifli hizbi used such pronouncements to humiliate those who failed to enlist in the TPLF
as ‘opportunist’.
Another method of arousing the youth was that of selecting slogans that appealed
to the manhood of each young adult. At the end of every youth mass rally, the cadre
called out slogans designed to encourage the youth to join the TPLF. Such slogans
included: ‘The hero for his land, the coward for his belly!’ The selected slogans were
echoed from among the youth. The TPLF usually assigned selected youngsters to work in
their respective associations before they were sent to the training centres. Since this
arrangement was secret, the new recruits pretended to speak on behalf of the youth.
Discussions in the youth associations and other youth gatherings revolved around
the armed struggle. Other issues of youth and community had no place in the discussions
and policies and those who raised social and economic issues were viewed as traitors to
the Tigraian cause. One of the methods the TPLF used to mobilize the youth was drama.
Those who had joined the Front, including those who promised to do so, were portrayed
as ‘the true heirs of the heroic forefathers’, and the others were branded as the
‘humiliation to the people and history of Tigrai’.
TPLF efforts to mobilize the youth were successful. However, as the number of
peasant combatants overtook those from the cities and towns, the effect was that the
majority of the combatants now were illiterate. This became a handicap for the TPLF, as
it became difficult to find enough literate combatants for the ever-expanding
communication and command posts. The Front tried to satisfy the demand for literate
combatants by training young combatants in its training centres. These combatants were
selected to fill gaps in units such as radio communication, unit commissars, mass
organization and foot doctors. Alongside this, a literacy campaign was waged in all units
and departments of the organization, but the need for literate combatants was still not
satisfied.
298In a further endeavour to boost its army, the TPLF turned its schools in the
liberated areas into political and literary training centres. Initially, the schools were
established by the TPLF and financed by international aid agencies and Tigraians in the
Diasporas but faced with the total closure of all state schools in the liberated territories,
campaigning against the deterioration of education conditions was required. The peasants
sent some of their younger children to school but the older boys and girls were needed to
help in the farms. Therefore, the schools served the younger children, and only seasonally
did the young adolescents attend classes.
There were not many qualified teachers in the liberated territories. Those who had
taught in the state schools in these areas either fled to the towns or joined the TPLF or
other movements. The TPLF gave political and academic training in its training centres to
men and women in the liberated areas with some educational background. These trainees
were then assigned to schools as teachers. By 1985 there were about 674 TPLF-trained
teachers and 58 primary schools with 19,800 pupils (TPLF 1978 E.C.: 138-39). But this
still did not solve the immediate needs of the TPLF.
Its motto that all human and material resources should serve the interests of the
war project was applied to the education system. As of 1983, the Front changed the
schools’ admission policy and only young men and women who could be called up to
join the army attended school. The schools became political and educational training
centres for TPLF departments and army units.
To intensify its propaganda work, the TPLF established a boarding school in 1983
for selected young and fresh recruits as well as the younger members of the army.
Students in these schools could be placed in TPLF army units or departments at will. By
1985, there were about 2,000 youngsters in boarding schools (ibid.: 140) that were
mainly run by TPLF combatants and where training was intensive and comprehensive.
Young combatants were however also admitted to these schools to increase their
academic capabilities in general.
Alienated from land, discouraged from establishing families, denied the right of
mobility, forcefully organized and controlled by the TPLF, bereft of any perspective and
299life outside the TPLF, the Tigraian youth saw their predicament as a corollary of ethno-
national oppression as they were mobilized to shoulder the brunt of the armed struggle in
Tigrai. It was this situation that helped the TPLF army to grow against all odds.
‘Neutralizing’ the Church and Mobilizing Muslims
The Church
A combination of factors made relations between the TPLF and the church difficult.
Firstly, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church had been at the centre of the villages’ social life
for centuries. Weddings, christenings (baptisms), burial rites and mediation in conflicts
between neighbours all took place via the church, and there were substantial numbers of
priests in every parish who performed church services. Each household had a priest as its
religious ‘father’ who took care of the spiritual life of the family and was called for
special life-cycle events to give his blessing. In every community the Church was
connected to each household in this way.
Secondly, the church constituted a link between the people and the state. It had
always stood on the side of past emperors, who furthered the existence, expansion and
unity of the Ethiopian Church. It was organized hierarchically from the village to the
national centre and as an embodiment of spiritual and socio-cultural life. The institution
of the church had always played a crucial role not only in community life but also in
mediation between rival forces and even between the state and rebels. The church taught
its followers to respect their allegiance to the Ethiopian state and was, in effect, a school
for national consciousness, using national symbols such as the flag in all religious and
social events. No church ever conducted major ceremonies without hoisting the Ethiopian
flag – an act also regularly observed in the Ethiopian army.
Thirdly, the church was the core legitimizing body for any emperor who ruled
over Ethiopia. It had been a tradition in Ethiopia that emperors had to be anointed in
Mariam-Tsion, the Holy Church of Aksum in Tigrai. They repaid the support of the
300church by granting gulti land to monasteries. The monasteries and the gädams then
claimed at least a fifth of the produce of the gulti land.
The local people were also allocated land for the upkeep of the church and priests
were compensated for their services. Land was the most important incentive and
encouraged many young men to invest time in going to church schools to become priests.
All priests in active service in a parish received rim land for their services. The
administration of the land and the church was in the hand of a gabaz. The gabaz could be
a priest or a layman selected by the community and approved by the church.
After the collapse of the monarchy and the military takeover of power in 1974, the
state-church alliance came to an end. The Dergue proclaimed socialism and nationalized
all church land. Abune Tewoflos, then the patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church,
was imprisoned and later murdered by those in power. By 1975, the church was cornered
by the Marxist military regime, the left-wing armed struggles and the national
movements in the north. The church initially saw hope in the Ethiopian rightist
movements, especially the EDU, which was involved in armed resistance in Tigrai and
Gondar, but nothing ever materialized.
The pragmatic TPLF understood the church’s role in village social life and its
support for the unity of the country. It also understood a possible alliance between the
Church with forces that stood against socialism and nationalization of the land as well as
against separatism. The church was viewed as a force standing in the way of the TPLF
but one that should be handled with caution. The TPLF had never been anti-religion as
such, although its Marxist ideology called for that. Nevertheless, there was no doubt that
that it wanted to subordinate the church to its cause.
The TPLF therefore took a series of coordinated steps to neutralize the church’s
influence. The first was, to uphold the Dergue’s measure of nationalization of church
land, which denied the church its economic power and frustrated hopes of resurgence
among the rightist multinational movement in Tigrai, such as the EDU. The centuries-old
economic status of the church was broken and it was forced to enter into new social
contracts with its followers. Gulti land was no longer controversial and, as far as the rim
301was concerned, the peasants saw it as a fair compensation for parish priests for their
services: the nationalization of rim land met resistance not only from the church but also
from the community. During the first phase of land distribution, many localities refused
to distribute rim land. Threatened by mass resistance, the TPLF tolerated the continued
ownership of rim land in such localities and in fact used it as a means of justifying its
recognition of the importance of the church.
The second step was to try and move the socio-economic focus of life from the
church to the people’s assemblies. All administrative and social activities were taken over
by the associations and the baitos and even church affairs such as the rights and
obligations of the church and its followers fell under the jurisdiction of the assemblies.
The capacity of the church to mobilize and influence the people waned. The church lost
its status as mediator in conflicts, rights over spiritual and familiar issues because the new
political authorities did not support it.
Thirdly, the TPLF launched a series of conferences or ‘seminars’ for selected
parish priests in 1979 to win them over. The underlying motive of the seminars was to
isolate the church in Tigrai from the wider Ethiopian church in order to foster Tigraian
nationalism along the lines of the TPLF’s strategic objective. Suppressed Tigraian
nationalism was invoked to challenge the dominant Ethiopian Orthodox Church. The
initial woreda seminars for priests were conducted by an eloquent TPLF fighter, Gebre-
Kidan Desta, a graduate of the Theological College at Addis Ababa University. The
themes of the seminars were to replace the Ethiopian Church’s authority by a TPLF-
minded church and the language in the church with Tigrigna and, ultimately, to further
Tigraian nationalism and identity.
This process involved the mobilization of parish priests and ordinary Christians to
isolate them from the church’s national hierarchy. To weaken church authority, an
intelligence group was formed under Sibhat Nega to infiltrate the well-established
monasteries in Tigrai, such as Debre Damo, by planting TPLF members camouflaged as
monks and influencing church activities in the interests of the TPLF.
302In 1987 and 1989, regional and national conferences for priests were organized by
the TPLF in liberated territories to reshape the Tigrai Church in line with the TPLF’s
programme. A separate secretariat of the Orthodox Church was formed in the liberated
areas of Tigrai and was supposed to operate under TPLF guidelines. Practically, the
Ethiopian Church was divided in two separate secretariats, one under the regime and the
other under the TPLF. Both worked in Tigrai until 1990, when the TPLF overran Meqele,
the capital of Tigrai. The regime’s secretariat fled Meqele for Dessie and the secretariat
in the liberated territories entered Meqele and operated there until the TPLF seized state
power in 1991.
Muslims
Muslims in Tigrai constituted a substantial minority. Although an earlier estimate stated
that ‘Tigray is 70% Christian and 30% Muslim in broad terms’ (Hammond 1989: 102),
the 1994 National Census data concluded that the number of Muslims was 4-5 % (CSA
1998: 132). In traditional Tigrai, Muslims had less chance to acquire land than Christians
and were discriminated against. Most of the Muslims specialized in trade and handicrafts
and today the Muslim community in Tigrai controls a large part of the business and
service sector of the economy. Consequently, the majority of Muslims in Tigrai live in
towns. Those in the countryside were engaged in farming, retail trade and handicrafts and
lived in small settlements all over Tigrai. There was little intermarriage with the
Christians and as the kingdom was exclusively Christian, the Muslim enclaves were
under constant harassment by the authorities. Muslim settlements remained relatively
unchanged for centuries although mobility was possible from one settlement to another or
to the towns. In most cases, Muslim weavers who worked in Christian areas could not get
land for dwelling and workplaces and had to find shelter and work space from their
Christian hosts.
The Muslims in Tigrai did not shed any tears following the collapse of the
Christian monarchy in 1974. Both the regime’s land proclamation and the TPLF’s land
policy in the liberated areas were a milestone achievement for Muslim highlanders in the
303struggle for equality and a better livelihood. Under the TPLF land policy, the amount of
land granted to individual households depended on the number of mouths each household
had to feed. Boundaries were redrawn between neighbouring villages and woredas to
balance relations in neighbouring localities, and the hitherto isolated Muslim enclaves
could now claim more land.
Muslims in towns in the liberated areas were not entitled to own land because like
other town dwellers they were not engaged in agriculture. Only those involved in farming
received land. But the TPLF granted land to most people in the towns, including
Muslims, to win support. The claim to land and its possession was a source not only of
income but also of prestige and status.
The TPLF avoided involvement in several thorny issues raised by the Muslim
community. One was marriage under Shari’a law. Many Muslim women raised the issue
of unfair marriage and divorce practices in Muslim society in Tigrai in the women’s
associations in which both Muslims and Christians participated. The TPLF avoided the
issue by indicating that they would tackle the problem in the future.
The participation of the Muslim community in the mass associations and baitos
increased dramatically and many Muslim women assumed leadership positions in the
associations. This was indeed experienced as a step forward and the TPLF saw the long-
oppressed Muslim community as a readily available ally in the struggle and invested time
and effort in mobilizing them. To make the Muslim community feel that they were well-
represented in the TPLF, many Christian combatants adopted Muslim names.
Participation of Muslim youths in the army was also growing as the struggle progressed.
The People’s Council (Baito): Reconfiguration of Local Administration
In the Imperial era, the absence of effective, accessible and affordable civil
administration in the countryside was the most important issue for the peasants in Tigrai.
The administrator, the police chief and the chief judge constituted the three most
304important state representatives in the woreda, which was made up of a district of seven to
fourteen tabia (villages). These state organs were not in a position to provide the
necessary services for the people in the entire woreda. For many, they were neither
accessible nor affordable and those who sought justice had to finance the court costs
themselves. Distance was also a problem: most people had to walk a day or more to see a
judge.
In addition, in most of the remote areas organized bandits reigned over the people.
They terrorized the local people at night and state officials during the day. And in remote
villages like Shimelba, strong bandits such as Alemshet Tewolde even effectively ruled
during the day. State officials sometimes had a tacit agreement of coexistence with the
leaders of the bandits, and they often mediated between bandit leaders and the state. It
was not uncommon to see a one-time bandit leader later occupying a state post in Tigrai.
Towards 1978, the TPLF through an extensive campaign, had brought an end to banditry
in rural Tigrai. It had called on the bandits to lay down their arms and return to civilian
life or join the TPLF. Many complied and surrendered their arms to the TPLF and those
who defied the call were hunted down by TPLF units, supported by the peasants.
As soon as it liberated territories from government control, the TPLF formed
local administrations at the village (tabia) level and the people elected a committee to
replace the abandoned state organs. They adopted a constitution (sirit) with the support
of the TPLF and the committee appointed a ‘village keeper’ (kodere) from among the
people. The kodere was responsible for getting all sorts of provisions (food, drink,
donkeys for transport and individuals to carry fragile materials) from the people for
TPLF units or individuals with a TPLF mission whenever they came to his tabia. The
TPLF militias usually served as police and liaison officers between the TPLF leadership
and the assembly.
TPLF cadres organized and supervised the local administrative organs, the
core institution of which became the baito, the ‘people’s council’. Initially, the
basic organs were the firdi baito (tribunal), the chairman of the tabia assembly
(the hamlet or village meeting), and the militia. For the first time in rural Tigrai,
305justice and administration became accessible and free to all, as individuals were
able to obtain justice in their own neighbourhood without having to travel long
distances or pay court fees. Moreover, decisions by the baito were subject to
reconsideration if flaws were detected and when the TPLF cadre, usually the kifli
hizbi, found it necessary. Whenever disputes arose between tabias, a mass
gathering was called at which village shimagles took centre stage and the kifli
hizbi was the moderator. Cases were settled by general consensus.
As the TPLF managed to defeat the rival organizations and push them out
of Tigrai in contested areas, the people were confronted with either the TPLF or
the Dergue. They did not have a choice as to who ruled over them: it was decided
by means of fire power. In the semi-liberated areas where the Dergue and the
TPLF ruled alternately, the TPLF formed assemblies. When the regime’s forces
intruded, the TPLF assemblies suspended their work and their officials either went
underground or retreated to the liberated areas. Where the regime recaptured a
town and reinstated its administration, the TPLF baitos moved their seats to the
surrounding countryside and continued to operate. The baitos in such zones, for
example Sheraro and Idaga-arbi, were prone to attack by the Dergue. The regime
targeted the baito officials in particular and the communities often became
engaged in pitched battles. Many of them lost their lives and property, and still
others had to join the Front as fulltime fighters.
The recurring shifts in authority in the towns and villages had long-term
repercussions for the rights and mobility of the people in the areas involved. On
the one hand, people’s livelihoods were constantly being destabilized and their
mobility hampered by the war situation. On the other, each side demanded
absolute loyalty from the people under its control in fighting against what they
both called ‘the enemy’. The limited freedom the people had because of the
presence of rival movements operating in the same area was slowly being eroded
by the military situation. In the final resort, the TPLF prevailed in large parts of
306Tigrai and began to act as a quasi government, with Tigrai becoming almost a
separate state.
The TPLF’s guiding motto, ‘Let the masses be conscious, organized and armed’,
dominated all socio-economic and political life in the liberated areas of Tigrai. Existing
structures and authorities were consolidated and were assigned new tasks, as we saw in
the case of the village assembly, restructured and renamed the people’s council, the baito.
This institution existed in traditional society (see Aberra 2000: 45) as an elected local
assembly of tax-paying, land-holding people and authority figures, but underwent
changes. It became the assembly through which local people were organized and
expressed political decisions guided by the TPLF. The baito was an assembly based on
membership from a number of villages and hamlets (tabia), and from the district
(woreda) was extended to a zonal (zoba) level.
The baito was the central organ in a structure of local units.
The TPLF brought together all the tabia mass associations to form woreda mass
associations. Representatives from the tabia associations created the respected woreda
mass associations and it became easier for the TPLF to mobilize and control the
associations. The organization of the mass associations at woreda level was the final step
to setting up the woreda people’s assembly, the baito. A woreda assembly was formed by
a founding congress composed of delegates from the mass associations in the respective
woreda. ‘In this manner, baitos were created in 33 woredas and 3 towns’ (TPLF 1978 E
C.: 73). Several woreda baitos convened at zone (zoba) level when the TPLF deemed it
necessary. The Zoba Baito was guided by the Mass Organizations’ Department in the
TPLF’s politburo.
The woreda baito, alternatively called the People’s Revolutionary Assembly or
Council, consisted of the committees for public works, administration and social affairs.
The committee for administration was entrusted with the task of ensuring the security
situation in the area and assigned patrol groups at strategic spots to monitor enemy
movements. The members of the patrol group were usually unarmed peasants working in
shifts, and all able-bodied adults took part in this activity.

Figure 7.1 Structure of the Baito
Militia forces, known locally as woyenti, were reorganized at the zoba (zone) and woreda
(district) levels as a defence and combat force of local communities. The TPLF promised
members of the militia and other cadres in the mass associations that the people in their
respective localities would be able to farm their land and take care of their families when
they were away from home on organizational missions. The baito administrative branch
carried out this pledge. For example, Senayt Adhanom, a peasant woman from Sheraro,
stated: ‘I have no oxen but because my husband is a fighter, I got them from the people’
(quoted in Hammond 1989: 78). The militia engaged the enemy sometimes on their own
308and sometimes alongside the TPLF regular army units, while other functionaries in the
mass associations spent more of their time on organizational activities.
Due to concerns about intelligence leaks, people were not allowed to move about
in the liberated areas without a pass. With instructions from the security section, the tabia
baitos were responsible for issuing these permits and any individual who wanted to travel
from one woreda to another had to obtain a valid written permit with the TPLF seal on it.
Failure to do so would result in the subject being placed on a suspect list as an enemy
agent.
The public works (or economic) committee of the baito procured material
resources for the armed struggle. The committee mobilized and coordinated people to
farm communal land and land that belonged to the TPLF. It organized the harvesting of
produce on this land, campaigned for fundraising on behalf of the TPLF and was one of
the instruments for regulating trade and collecting taxes for the TPLF.
The justice department constituted the woreda court. It took care of civil peace and
adjudicated in civil disputes between community members. Resolution of all civil
disputes in communities was entrusted to this section of the baito. The TPLF, through its
cadres, supervised the performance of the committee and now and then called public
meetings and scrutinized the activities of the justice committees. People who felt they had
not received justice could present their grievances to a court headed by community elders
(shimagle) and the TPLF kifli hizbi who had the final say on all matters.
The TPLF recruited and trained thousands of cadres from the areas under its
control and from all sections of society, the majority of which were with peasant
background. These cadres were known as Shig-weyenti (‘torch bearers of the
revolution’). The individual Shig-weyanay operated in his/her own association and in the
baitos. Through those cadres, the TPLF was able to control the activities of the baitos and
the society at large. In the first instance, they were constituted by delegates from the mass
associations in which the Shig-weyenti were active members. TPLF cadres also led and
controlled the mass associations and since the Shig-weyenti had direct contact with the
309TPLF, they were informed as to what was at stake and given directives on how to
respond accordingly.
The tasks of the baitos were to implement the TPLF’s war policies and were
organized in such a way that they could generate the maximum contribution to the
movement’s project. TPLF control of the baitos was mainly from above, as the structure
indicated, and through its directives, while the mass associations were the means of
mobilizing and controlling the people. Their representatives were pooled to form the
woreda people’s assemblies, ending up as a TPLF department as in government
bureaucracy.
The baito was elected by the people directly and according to some observers
‘independent of the TPLF’ (Hammond 1999: 82), but that was just rhetoric. Hammond
could have noted that, as the TPLF itself had stated ((TPLF 1978 E.C.: 73-74): ‘The baito
is the foundation of the future people’s government and would be led by the dictatorship
of the workers, poor and middle peasants, using the principle of democratic centralism’.
To make sure the formation of the baito and its subsequent activities did not contradict its
ideological and political line, the TPLF conducted ‘assessments’ (gämgäm) and
‘rectification (tsereyet) among the people, the associations and future baito candidates as
part of the consolidation process. In the course of years, hundreds of peasants were
accused of collaborating with the enemy or of acting against the armed struggle. Many
were interned and others were killed. Members of the CCs of the associations and of the
people’s councils who were not in favour of the TPLF were purged.
The continued allegiance of the members of the baitos was assured by the TPLF’s
principle of democratic centralism, originally a Leninist tenet combining party
democracy with strict hierarchical methods of execution of party decisions. The TPLF’s
organizational work was controlled at all levels according to this principle of democratic
centralism. Deviation from TPLF policies and directives by any association or assembly
was practically impossible and dissidents were subject to recall by their respective
associations. Even a unanimous decision by the baito assembly had no validity if it went
310against the interests of the TPLF as determined by democratic centralism. The TPLF
could dismiss the entire assembly or have all its members recalled by their organization.
The TPLF’s authority in the liberated areas thus took hold. No rival ethnically
based or multinational movements were operating in Tigrai by 1978. Every member of
society was organized in every possible way on the basis of age, sex, occupation or
religion. With the establishment of the baitos in most of the woredas, the TPLF became a
quasi government and Tigrai almost a separate state. TPLF slogans became decrees and
its propaganda was strictly observed like a law. The main programme was to win the war
and all activities and human and material resources had to be mobilized for this aim. The
mass associations and the assemblies (baitos) basically came to function as appendages
of the TPLF. They could not independently serve the people that they represented by
putting pressure on the TPLF, an organization they called Widebna or Wideb. The mass
organizations thus inevitably became tools of the TPLF.
Summary
The armed struggle strategy based on the Maoist model of carrying out a ‘revolution in
the countryside to envelop and engulf the cities’101 was in progress in the rural areas of
Tigrai with the TPLF developing a comprehensive policy to organize and guide the
population in the service of the war effort and the social-revolutionary ideals that it had
set. Taking into account social status, gender, age and religious profile of the people, new
forms of organizational mobilization were developed, comprising voluntary and coercive
approaches. Associations of peasant farmers, women and youth, and even religious
groups were formed with the guidance of the Front at village and woreda (district) level.
Nobody was left behind, whether one liked it or not, yet no association was in a position
to defend or articulate its members’ interest as much as it was required to defend the
101 Cited in Sam C. Sarkesian, ed., Revolutionary Guerrilla Warfare, (Chicago: Precedent
Publishing, Inc. 1975), p. 3.
311interest of the Front, i.e. ‘the struggle’. The pervasive thinking was that the interest of the
associations and the society at large would be best served after the war against the
oppressive system come to an end. The main preoccupation of the associations was
therefore to render all necessary support to win the war against the government, and then
realize the ‘self-determination’ of Tigrai, whatever this meant for different segments of
the society.
This did not mean that in these domains no gains were made. Local Tigrai society
was significantly transformed. At all levels of rural society, there was the structure of
people’s councils known as baito, responsible for the overall administration of respective
communities and based on older forms of community administration. Baito officials
were, however, either peasant cadres or ardent supporters of the struggle, and hence of
the TPLF. Their service was pivotal in that they linked the TPLF with the populace, apart
from executing the programs of the Front, like land reform in the rural areas. From the
activities of the associations, it appeared women in particular were gaining some freedom
out of the male-dominated society of Tigrai. This particular case was indeed a new
phenomenon in traditional Tigrai, although it may be identified as a by-product, for in the
final analysis it was a male-dominated TPLF that guided and controlled the activities of
the women’s associations. Women in Tigrai could not forge their own independent or
autonomous association. This leads us to conclude that all mass-focused activities of the
TPLF, while carrying advantages for the target groups, were primarily geared to the
consolidation of the Front in the countryside of Tigrai, thereby creating a power base
through controlled social reforms that could not exceed their limits to become
revolutionary and attain total change. Thus the Front became a dominant force based on
‘mobilized consent’, or, to use the words of Gramsci, on ‘hegemony armoured by
coercion’ (in Hoare and Smith 1971: 265).
312Chapter 11
Turning Point: The Fall of the Dergue and the Triumph of the TPLF
Introduction
In this chapter I discuss the end game of the military confrontation of the TPLF with the
Dergue regime since the mid-1980s to 1991. This will be accompanied by a brief
assessment of the conduct of the TPLF elite in its initial moments in power, and which
are a direct reflection of the history of the movement presented in the previous chapters.
Sapped by its efforts to control and rule Ethiopian society by force, thereby
isolating itself from its own people, the Dergue faced mounting defeats at the hands of
the insurgents in Tigrai and Eritrea. It reached a stage where it could only make moves to
buy time. The two fronts, the TPLF in Tigrai and the EPLF in Eritrea by the mid-80s had
become large and competent enough to challenge the government army, then one of the
largest in Sub-Saharan Africa, in conventional warfare. Mustering a huge quantity of
weaponry, including T-55 tanks and heavy artillery captured from previous engagements
with the Dergue, both Fronts were poised to bring the war to its final stages in 1990. The
OLF’s less spectacular activities in the southwest and the simmering opposition of the
Ethiopian people in general had also caused the Dergue to falter elsewhere in the country.
The Dergue’s own terms of engagement, military confrontation, did not help in the
face of the thrust of the insurgent movements, as it has lost its domestic legitimacy and
made the ordinary people weary from the violence, the lack of democratic governance
and the continuous ‘sacrifices’ to be made.. The fronts were encouraged and supported by
most of the local population as they advanced to wards the centre of the country, the last
stronghold of the military regime (cp. Young 1997; Hammond 1999; Kassahun 2000). As
313in late 1990-early 1991 the Dergue failed to come to grips with the insurgent attacks,
there was intervention of foreign powers to mediate for peaceful transition of power, but
that was too late to save the Dergue from defeat. The TPLF and its junior partners
constituting the EPRDF, seized power in May 1991, and the TPLF elite, dominating the
scene, began to implement policies that would shape the future of the country.
Ethnic mobilization evidently enabled the elite of the TPLF to build its force and
dislodge the well-established Dergue regime, but the ethnically mobilized populace in the
North was not in a position to influence the new power holders. The dominant posture of
the TPLF over the guidance of the struggle, as discussed in previous chapters, continued
to prevail after it seized power. This in turn has created a new relationship between the
political elite and the people on the one hand and between the new power holders and
Ethiopian people in general and between them and the country’s ethnic groups in various
states of mobilisation on the other.
The Dergue Falters102
In 1987 of the twenty-five combat divisions the Dergue commanded, thirteen – including
two mechanized divisions – were deployed in Eritrea. According to a TPLF military
intelligence report of February 1987, this force then constituted 71,500 men and was
called the Second Revolutionary Army (SRA). It was classified into four Ezze
(commands) with three to four divisions under each Ezze, out of which the Nadew
(Demolish) Ezze led by the revered General Tariku Ayne was the strongest. It was based
in Af-Abet, facing the steep Nakfa hills where the EPLF’s pronged trenches were located.
‘Even though the operation in Eritrea was headquartered in Asmara, Af-Abet was
actually the command centre and the largest military garrison in Ethiopia with the
heaviest and most sophisticated armaments’ (Dawit 1989: 364). Nadew was entrenched in
the strategic terrain of Af-Abet, between the Sahil lowlands, the EPLF’s strong-hold, and
314the more populated highlands under the control of the Dergue. The other three Ezzes
were dug in at Keren (not far from Af-Abet), Asmara and the port of Massawa. All were
in a defensive position, appearing to have lost the will to fight.
As the army was losing ground every day to the EPLF, the Commander-in-Chief
of the Ethiopian Armed Forces, president Mengistu Haile-Mariam, visited Af-Abet in
early February 1988, ‘allegedly to boost the morale of the soldiers but intent on punishing
those responsible for the failure’ (Gebru Tareke 2004: 249). On 15 February he ordered
the execution of General Tariku and the demotion of General Kebede Gashe, commander
of Mekkit (Challenge) Ezze, and many other high-ranking officers. The execution of
General Tariku Ayne caused great distress and panic in the entire armed forces (Dawit
Shifaw 2005: 180; Teferra 1977: 286; Dawit 1989: 365).
The EPLF then saw that the moment to strike was ripe. A month after the
execution of General Tariku and following the shockwaves this had sent through the
armed forces, the EPLF launched a condensed attack upon Nadew Ezze at Af-Abet from
17 to 19 March 1988. To the shock of every Dergue officer, the strategic garrison town of
Af-Abet fell into the hands of the insurgents. Major Dawit (1989) described the scene as
follows:
In less than 48 hours, rebel forces numbering only 15,000 overran 30 miles of
defence line, destroying an elite force of close to 100,000. … Over 5,000
troops surrendered to the rebel forces; 10,000 were killed; thousands crossed
the border to Sudan, and the rest ended up in Keren where they were stopped
by pleading officers and cadres. Lost to the rebels were over 50 Soviet-made
T-55-tanks, several ‘Stalin Organ’ rocket launchers, artillery weapons and
trucks in the hundreds, thousands of small arms, millions of rounds of
ammunitions … In an effort to regroup, Mengistu ordered the evacuation of all
troops in Tessenei, Agordet, Barentu and Marsa Teklai. Thus the rebels got
control of almost half of Eritrea in one 48-hour battle, and were now equipped
with the latest Soviet weapons (ibid.).
315Owing to the government army’s organizational failings and the determination of the
insurgents, Af-Abet fell into the hands of the EPLF. One Ethiopian army Major-General
Fanta Belay observed that: ‘…’the fall of Af-Abet was the secession of Eritrea’’ (cited in
Teferra 1997: 286). This prophecy would come true in a couple of years but not
immediately. The Dergue’s rearguard was still intact, which enabled it to prolong the
war, so something was needed to deplete its resources and support there if it was to be
defeated for good. The Dergue’s rearguard access vis-à-vis that of the TPLF and its
impact on the theatre of confrontation – the fronts of both warring forces – had until then
been affecting the war in favour of the former (see Chapter 6, section ‘Debate over
military strategy’).
Next to developments in Eritrea,, the TPLF was active in its offensives in Tigrai,
seizing town after town from the government army. At this point, the TPLF and the EPLF
were still at loggerheads (from 1985 until early 1988) and coordination by consent was
not possible. The Dergue’s dismal situation, however, prompted the TPLF to go for a
major offensive. The Shire-Enda Selassie operation once again had to be repeated. Had
there been amicable relations between the EPLF and the TPLF and with unarmed anti-
Dergue forces who were involved in invisible sabotage and offensive actions from the
rear, the Dergue might have collapsed much earlier.
Shire is the western district of Tigrai and was where the TPLF was founded and
began its armed struggle. The TPLF had cultivated strong popular support in this region,
which extended up to Dejena in Wolkait and across the Tekeze River, and its major base
area where it had established training schools, medical centres, firms and a radio station.
The district capital, Enda Selassie, had been a town of contention between the Dergue
and the TPLF since Mussie, the TPLF’s first commander, was incarcerated there in July
1975 and set free in the young Front’s very first operation. Ever since, the Dergue had
kept an eye on this region and on Enda Selassie in particular. A number of offensives in
the form of zemecha (campaigns) directed at destabilizing, if not annihilating, the TPLF
had been launched from Enda Selassie over the last thirteen years, but none had been able
316to prevent the TPLF from gaining strength. The TPLF was now preparing to upset the
balance forever. The Dergue was compelled to fully focus on the TPLF. ‘Hitherto, it [the
Dergue] believed that the defeat of the EPLF would lead to the easy eradication of the
other armed groups. Now it concluded that without the elimination of the TPLF, the
Eritrean rebellion could not be extinguished’ (Gebru 2004: 257). The TPLF’s military
activities beyond Tigrai into the neighbouring provinces of Gonder and Wollo on one
hand and the blockage of land transport between Addis Ababa and Asmara on the other
would naturally result in the consideration of a strategic shift, but appeared to be too late.
By then, the TPLF had reorganized into seven divisions, its manpower estimated at
56,000 (ibid: 260), and was supported by mechanized brigades and artillery units in
addition to thousands of local and militia forces.
In April 1988, the Dergue established the Third Revolutionary Army (TRA) by
combining its forces from the provinces of Wollo and Gonder. A month later, it declared
a state of emergency in the whole of Tigrai, with Sergeant Legesse Asfaw, a person no
less ruthless than Mengistu, as Chief Martial Law Administrator. With its headquarters in
Meqele, the capital of Tigrai, the TRA launched several campaigns to regain strategic
heights and towns relinquished to the TPLF. From June to August, the TRA’s 604 Army
Corps moved to recapture the towns that had surrendered earlier and managed to do so.
But after being attacked at Dansha it was forced to retreat in disarray to Enda Silassie. It
was during this campaign, on 22 June 1988, that Legesse ordered the aerial bombardment
of Hawzien. This attack, conducted by helicopter gunships and MiGs, resulted in 1,800
civilian deaths, the worst single atrocity of the war since the start of the ELF insurrection
in 1961 (De Waal 1991: 258).
TRA efforts to maintain its supply line between Eritrea and Tigrai were frustrated
by the defeat of its contingent at Rama on 29 September 1988. While the TRA was
expecting a joint operation with the support of the SRA’s 10th Division, the TPLF
captured Dabat in January 1989, thus controlling the road to Gonder. Not knowing where
and when to confront the rebels, the TRA moved to regain towns in central Tigrai in early
317February 1989. However it was caught by surprise in the hills of Selekhlekha and swiftly
retreated to its trenches, breaking the chain of command.
In its final attempt to prevail over the region of Shire, the TRA moved its
headquarters to Enda Selassie and regrouped, under its command, divisions from the 603
and 605 Army Corps, the entire 604 Army Corps and the 103rd commando division. With
this huge concentration of forces, it was able to regain towns southwest of Shire, like
Dabat and Debark on the way to Gonder, in early February 1989. This concentration of
forces was part of the TPLF’s plan to upset the stalemate by launching a major offensive.
In the event of posturing to launch a strategic offensive and snatch the initiative
from the enemy, both the TPLF and EPLF calmed down their bickering momentarily as
before, opened their eyes again for rapprochement and met in Khartoum. ‘The two fronts
resumed cooperation in 1988, but not on such close terms as before the breach of
relations in 1985’ (Tekeste Negash and Tronvoll 2000: 20). More than anything else,
their dream was military victory and amid the incessant battles, the renewed relationship
was going to serve them well, albeit for a short time and for a limited objective.
Four divisions of the Dergue’s army – the 4th, 9th and 16th divisions and the 103rd
commando division – had congregated in and around Enda Selassie, occupying the
commanding heights of Mt Qoyetsa, Mt Atarit and Mt Dembelailay, all of which are
above 2000 metres. The decisive assault on the concentration of the TRA corps in Enda
Selassie began on 15 February 1989 by making flank attacks on positions in Selekhlekha,
30 km southeast and on the commanding heights. As Hayelom Araya, the TPLF’s
cardinal commander put it, ‘The strategy of the rebels was to hit the isolated units
piecemeal first, seize the strategic heights, and then cut off the two divisions from their
main headquarters at Indasilase, encircle and demolish them with one concentrated
attack’ (in Gebru 2004: 265). That was exactly what the insurgents did in Shire-Enda
Selassie, but it was not an easy battle. Fighting raged in three main flanks of the enemy
when two EPLF mechanized brigades came to support the TPLF and tilted the balance in
their favour. It was a vital contribution but did not bring the battle to an end. ‘Still, the
unit refused to budge, effectively directing its tanks, artillery, … Unable to break the
318impregnable defence, the guerrillas shifted the line of attack’ (ibid.: 267). Yet, as Young
(1997: 164) observed, ‘The presence of the EPLF brigade represented both the result in
tangible form of the recent unity agreement and the TPLF’s continuing weakness in the
sphere of heavy artillery’.
The perseverance of the insurgents, coupled with the flexibility of their tactics,
disoriented and demoralized the TRA’s fighting spirit. They surrendered the commanding
heights one after the other. Gebru (2004: 268) describes the scene:
Pandemonium turned into fright when the command and control centres of the
Corps and 4th Division were hit almost simultaneously, precipitating the
breakdown of the chain of command. In the ensuing confusion and turmoil, over
200 trucks as well as armoured cars rushed south towards Gondar with some
guerrillas hard on their heels. The 604 Corps had crumbled. The TPLF had
prevailed.
Finally, on the afternoon of 19 February 1989, the battle of Enda Selassie came to an end
and, according to Gebru and Young, ‘…close to 12,000 Dergue soldiers were killed or
taken prisoners’ (ibid.: 269, 1997: 164). During a mop-up operation on the way to
Gonder, two generals – Addis Agilachew and Hailu Kebede – were found dead. They had
presumably committed suicide.
The immediate effect of Enda Selassie was unexpected even for the TPLF, which
had started up operations with limited numbers of men and needed time to reorganize its
forces for the following phase. The next day, the Dergue withdrew its forces from the
towns of Humera and Adigrat to Gonder and Meqele, the capitals of Gonder and Tigrai
respectively. A week later, on 25 February 1989, a dramatic evacuation from Meqele
took place. All government officials, accompanied by 20,000 troops, hurriedly left
Meqele bound for Dessie, the capital of Wollo Province, south of Tigrai. Within a week,
no traces were left in Tigrai of the government army. ‘In February 1989, a victory at
Enda-Selassie by the TPLF left it in control of the whole of Tigrai’, (Clapham 1991:
319465). The people of Tigrai were spared further ground onslaughts but the aerial
bombardments continued. Tigrai was ‘liberated’ as the nationalist leadership of the TPLF
had envisaged it would be, but this did not mean the end of the war.
President Mengistu Haile-Mariam, the Commander-in-Chief, was in a state of
shock and his regime was disintegrating. He immediately forged a team to investigate the
fall of Enda Selassie and in his directives, Mengistu lamented:
A huge army has fallen, scattered or surrendered within days and hours in a
manner that is beyond belief. Quantities of weapons and property that will
profoundly impact on the unity and survivability of the state have fallen into the
enemy hands. It is no exaggeration to say that this lamentable [episode] will
occupy a disgraceful place not only in the history of Ethiopia’s struggle, but also
in world military history. We are now in a situation where it is impossible to
predict what the eventual outcome will be. (in Gebru Tareke 2004: 269-70)
It was not impossible to predict the eventual outcome after the SRA’s defeat at Af-Abet
in March 1988 and the collapse of the TRA at Enda Selassie in February 1989. The two
strongest armies of the regime, the TRA in Tigrai and the SRA in Eritrea were in
irreversible retreat. The balance had shifted in favour of the insurgents and the
government army had been forced from an offensive position into a defensive strategy.
The situation in the Dergue’s camp was aggravated by the retreating troops that were
spreading waves of fear. One part of the defeated army, which was not under any chain of
command, was estimated to be about 6,000 strong (ibid.: 268) and was spreading panic as
it retreated to the provinces of Gonder and Wollo, where it was forced at gunpoint by
commanders to stop, regroup and fight back. But the Dergue was already in hot water.
Released POWs from previous battles had spread news of the resoluteness of the rebels
and the inevitable expansion of the war into the central provinces. Some of the POWs had
even joined the TPLF to fight the military regime. On 12 January 1989, a former senior
320navy lieutenant, Dawit Shifaw (2005: 195), who was re-indoctrinating 4,475 freed POWs
in Tatek Military Base near Addis Ababa, wrote:
Another war that the Tigraian rebels were waging at this time was releasing the
prisoners of war in thousands. …They [former POWs] told me that after
listening to the indoctrination of the TPLF in prison camps some of the POWs
voluntarily joined the rebel forces to fight against their own government.
This reflected the state of mind of the Dergue army after fourteen years of protracted war
against the rebels and, even more so, the retreating defeated troops. To make matters
worse, Legesse put the blame on the commanders and sent many to prison for failing to
win the battles in Tigrai. Mengistu showed no mercy when dealing with them. ‘Such
irrationalities of Legesse and Mengistu annoyed most of the Ethiopian generals who
attempted to overthrow the dictator on May 16, 1989’ (ibid.: 201).
The Descent of the Dergue and the Ascent of the TPLF
This coup attempt was another blow struck at the centre, this time from the generals of
the Dergue. On 16 May 1989, Mengistu Haile Mariam flew to the German Democratic
Republic (GDR) in an attempt to acquire more weapons. As usual, high-ranking generals
and ministers were at the airport to see him off. Immediately after Mengistu took off, the
generals headed straight to the Ministry of Defence and executed what appeared to be a
well-planned change of leadership in a coup d’état. The meeting was well represented by
top generals from every branch of the armed forces. The former Commander of the Air
Force and, at the time, Minister of Industry, Major General (M/G) Fanta Belay, the
Minister of Defence M/G Haile-Giorgis Habit -Mariam, Commander of the Air Force
M/G Amaha Desta, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, M/G Merid Negussie, Chief of
Operations, M/G Aberra Abebe, Commander of the Ground Forces, M/G Hailu Gebre-
321Michael, Commissioner of Police, M/G Worku Zewdie and the Commander of the Navy,
Rear-Admiral Tesfaye Berhanu met and began discussing the details of their plan to
dethrone Mengistu. It looked as if they had been waiting for this moment, but as it proved
later on it was not well organized. Two hours later, they found themselves surrounded by
Mengistu’s special guards. It so happened that the Defence Minister, Haile Giorgis, was
among Mengistu loyalists and he had some how slipped out of the meeting only to
reappear with Mengistu Hailemariam’s aide-de-camp, Captain Mengistu Gemechu and
No. 2 Chief of Security Tesfay Wolde-Selassie who led the elite force to abort the coup
d’état. Incidentally, in the shoot-out, it was General Haile-Giorgis who became the first
victim and died instantly. M/G Amaha Desta and M/G Merid Negussie took their own
lives on the spot. The coup failed miserably and the other plotters were either killed or
taken prisoner. General Kumlachew Dejenie, Deputy Commander of the SRA, who
stayed outside the meeting in Addis Ababa and M/G Demissie Bulto, Commander of the
SRA in Asmara, made efforts to reverse the situation but it was too late. Mengistu’s
confidantes were after the rebellious officers. Mengistu himself called off his visit and
arrived in Addis Ababa on 18 May 1989 and continued the hunt for the plotters and their
associates. According to Mengistu, in Asmara alone, ‘11 generals and 27 other officers
were killed while 7 generals and 133 other officers were detained’, (Dawit, 2005: 218).
The Ethiopian army was badly impaired as it had become evident that the onslaught
continued not only from the side of the insurgents but also from within its own hierarchy,
which was equally damaging.
The soldiers retreating from Tigrai had been forced to regroup in Dessie and
Gonder for some months in the grim hope of fighting back. The Dergue was rushing in
soldiers who had been forcefully conscripted into the demoralized army in an effort to
stop the advancing TPLF fighters, who were now more highly motivated than ever. The
TPLF’s motivation, however, had a downside to it: some of the fighters began raising the
point of fighting outside Tigrai, a rerun of their previous ethno-nationalist orientation that
focused on the liberation of Tigrai. Just a year before, their leaders had been bent on this
idea and were agitating for the fighters to follow suit. In its propaganda for the year 1979
322E.C. (1987/1988), which was prepared by Meles Zenawi and Abbay Tsehaye, the TPLF
had declared that every member of the League (MLLT) and the Front had to take part in a
campaign ‘to avoid the confusion created in the relationship of the ethno-national
question to the Ethiopian revolution and rectify the de-motivating view to the ethno-
national question’ (TPLF, 1979: 2). In this campaign, the entire TPLF membership had
been encouraged to embolden ethno-nationalist consciousness as opposed to a pan-
Ethiopian vision. Now that it had to fight the Dergue’s vast rearguard, which had hitherto
been ignored because of the prevailing ethno-nationalist view, the TPLF leadership was
confronted with the daunting task of ‘de-agitating’ its forces while pursuing the strategy
of decapitating the Dergue from behind – a strategy it adopted only reluctantly. To
advance this strategy, early in 1989 the TPLF had forged the Ethiopian People’s
Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), out of organizations it helped to form. These
were the Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement (EPDM), a splinter group of the
EPRP, the Oromo People’s Democratic Organization (OPDO) and the Ethiopian
Democratic Officers’ Revolutionary Movement (EDORM). The last two were created
from among the POWs taken by the TPLF.
In the months of March, April, May and June 1989, the TPLF in liberated Tigrai
while the Dergue forces in Dessie and Gonder outside Tigrai were reorganizing and
beefing up their forces for imminent confrontation. The TPLF’s aim was to advance to
central Ethiopia to the rear of the Dergue, while the Dergue was keen on recapturing its
positions in Tigrai. Amid resounding rebel victories, the Dergue intensified its forcible
recruitment of youth from schools, markets and the streets across the country and after a
short training programme deployed them to the fronts. Such hasty and irrational planning
was an act of desperation and was not able to help the army regain its morale or fighting
power and stop the advancing TPLF. Nevertheless, there were a number of engagements
triggered by the drives of both sides to gain more ground before the main offensive
commenced.
It was at this time that the TPLF rank and file began raising questions about
fighting outside Tigrai. The whispering campaign spread, recalling the ethno-nationalist
323agitation of the leadership, and many fighters began running away from their regiments to
their villages. The reactions of civilians in some towns outside Tigrai were not
encouraging either. ‘In response, some 10,000 fighters virtually spontaneously withdrew
and returned to Tigrai’ (Young 1997: 166-67). The leadership had to halt its movement
south of Tigrai and reorient the fighters because they, as Ethiopians, had the duty to get
rid of the enemy anywhere in Ethiopia – a task which was ridiculed for many years but
without which the victories in Tigrai could not be sustained. Parallel to this reorientation,
the TPLF leadership deployed squads to hunt for those who ran away from the war front,
forced their parents to hand them back and put some of them in jail. The situation was
brought under control following these measures.
By the end of July 1989, the TPLF had taken the initiative again and launched its
offensive outside Tigrai on two prongs, the Dessie and Gonder fronts, following the
mountainous central highlands that stretched all the way to Addis Ababa. The choice of
that route was of immense tactical advantage. Militarily, it reduced the effect of the
Dergue’s air superiority and also forced the enemy into engagement outside its trenches
and away from its supply lines. By now, the TPLF also had a political edge over the
Dergue. The local people had been at loggerheads with the Dergue for a number of years,
and were therefore in favour of the insurgents who were presenting themselves now not
as TPLF but as the EPRDF (Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front) that
had recently been forged precisely for this strategic purpose. Six TPLF divisions, namely
Alula, Aurora, Agazi, Maebel, Mekdela and May-Day, each with roughly 3,000
combatants including about 400 fighters from the EPDM were deployed on the fronts.
Stretching from Wollo to Gonder, the Dergue on the other hand had five divisions (the
3rd, 4th, 7th, 17th and 25th) with up to 15,000 soldiers in each. Because of the intensity of
the war and the heavy casualties on both sides, the number of troops fluctuated, at times
dropping abruptly until fresh recruits and reinforcements arrived.
With the TPLF/EPRDF on the offensive, fierce battles raged in the mountains and
gorges of Wollo and Gondar. From September 1989 to May 1990 there were running
battles. Places such as Nefas-Mewcha, Guguftu, Ataye, Mahil-Meda, Lemi, Kimer-
324Dingay, Debre-Tabor, Alem-Ketema and Meragna witnessed heavy fighting, and in
almost all cases it ended in defeat for the Dergue’s forces. Yet, in the Battle of Meragna
that lasted for three days in early June, the Dergue’s 3rd Division had the upper hand and
inflicted damage on the TPLF. Seare Mekonnen, commander of the TPLF Aurora
Division recalls:
We were once pushed by the 3rd Division to a point where we could not even
retrieve our wounded comrades. Meswaetinet [= ‘sacrifice’, ‘martyrdom’ A.B.]
became a daily scene. The enemy encircled us and caught some of our fighters.
Finally with the arrival of Alula [TPLF Division] to our side, we launched a
counter-offensive and destroyed the 3rd Division and captured its commander
Colonel Sereke Berhane. We also found our dead comrades soaked with blood
after they were tied and pushed down a steep cliff. (Woyeen, 1990: 3)
Such was the frenzy and cruelty of battle. The Dergue undoubtedly fought resolutely at
this battle but, finally, the tactical manoeuvrability and endurance of the insurgents
determined the outcome. According to Commander Seare, his Aurora Division had 3,000
fighters while the Dergue’s 3rd Division had 15,000 soldiers (ibid.), a ratio of 1 to 5. But
what mattered in such encounters was not the sheer number but the will to fight and the
ability to endure hardship. In his report to the Ethiopian Defence Minister, Brigadier
General Abebe Haile-Selassie confirmed that the tactical excellence of the insurgents was
beyond doubt.
The bandits had effectively utilized the guerrilla [Maoist] stratagem. For
instance, to strike at Debre-Tabor they pulled together all their forces from
the Wollo Front. To launch an attack at Weri-Elu and Alem-Ketema they left
South Gonder empty. To destroy the Lion 3rd Division, they amalgamated all
325their forces in Northern Wollo and Northern Showa. …We saw this
repeatedly and should have pondered over it.103
In the eyes of the general, the ‘bandits’ had become a menace not only to the army under
his command but also to the national military government itself. Following these events,
the port of Massawa fell into EPLF hands in 1990, while the Dergue was expecting attack
on Keren after Af-Abet. By the end of March 1990, the TPLF rebels had seized Bahir
Dar, the biggest town in the province of Gojjam, which was also an air base from which
the Dergue flew its sorties to Tigrai and Eritrea. Now the remaining fighter planes had to
move to Debre Zeit, southeast of Addis Ababa. The whole army was in retreat, with some
of the retreating troops having reached Wollega Province, south of Gojjam and west of
Showa.
Futile Peace Talks
Pressed by the advance of the insurgents to the seat of his government in Addis Ababa,
Mengistu Haile Mariam took a U-turn in ideology and in the political line he held. He
had seen the Soviet Union, his main backer, turning to a non-Communist path the year
before. With the Cold War coming to an end and the US emerging as the only super
power, he was left with no choice but turn to the West. In a national speech on 5 March
1990, he declared that socialism would not work in Ethiopia and his party, the Ethiopian
Workers’ Party, should be changed to the Ethiopian Democratic Union Party (EDUP).
This was clearly a message, if not an act of rapprochement, aimed at Western powers. His
calculation, understandably, was to at least neutralize the West, which had directly or
indirectly backed the insurgents during the Cold-War era. It was also a conciliatory call
103 The report of Brigadier-general Abebe Haile-Selassie is cited in the book Teraroch
Yanketekete Tiwled (Amharic), Mega publishing enterprise, 1989 E C., p. 193.
326to the people who were suffering under his dictatorship. He even sent out emissaries to
contact political organizations previously banned by his government, like the EPRP and
groups of former TPLF members. Five factions of the ELF were also contacted in
Khartoum, Sudan but these last-minute peace efforts were never taken seriously by any
side, as the Dergue was near collapse.
With the Italians as mediators, peace talks began in Rome towards the end of 1989
between representatives of the TPLF and the Dergue. Parallel talks were also going on
between the Dergue and the EPLF, but none came even close to bearing fruit, simply
because their positions were irreconcilable and there was no culture of peaceful
engagement for reaching a settlement acceptable to both sides. In addition, the insurgents
saw no point in negotiation with the Dergue so close to collapse. In his conversation with
Paul Henze in early April 1990, the EPRDF leader Meles Zenawi (1990: 16) said, ‘We
think the Dergue is too weak to be a partner in serious negotiation. The same is true, I
think, with respect to the EPLF. The Dergue has to be eliminated. We cannot
compromise with it.’ While President Mengistu was delivering his nationwide speech of
mobilization for a final showdown on 19 February 1991, EPRDF forces were closing in
on Addis Ababa. Mengistu portrayed himself as emperors Tewodros and Yohannes IV,
who would fight to the last for what they believed in, only to escape days later by
helicopter to Nairobi, Kenya on what was supposedly a visit to a militia training centre in
the south of Ethiopia. Finally, on 21 May 1991, Mengistu showed up in Harare,
Zimbabwe, where he requested asylum. The Council of State immediately called an
emergency meeting and appointed Lieutenant General Tesfay Gebre-Kidane as acting
president and Tesfaye Dinka as prime minister. Abandoned by their Commander in
Chief, there was nothing the new leaders, and for that matter the entire army, could do.
The new leaders hoped for a negotiated end to the catastrophe and an immediate
ceasefire. What could a rump government do in the face of a mighty force? All indicators
from diplomatic circles, NGOs and local and foreign journalists showed that they were
prepared to surrender.
327The US, which had been following events in Ethiopia closely through former
President Jimmy Carter who was mediating between the two sides in his role as head of
the Carter Centre, now assigned its Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs,
Herman Cohen, to mediate at a conference in London. The warring forces, the TPLF, the
EPLF and the OLF on the one hand and the Dergue on the other, were invited to peace
talks that could have allowed a smooth transition of power. However, given their track
record and with all parties having settled matters so far with the gun, it was futile to
consider a peaceful settlement at the eleventh hour. Giving the platform of peace talks
only to the armed contestants, while opposition groups who chose a peaceful path of
struggle were marginalized in negotiating the transition, was a short-sighted exercise.
This approach of settling conflicts or the transition of power only emboldened armed
groups instead of civilian power. No wonder then that the London peace talks impacted
negatively on future events in Ethiopia.
On 27 May 1991, the day the London conference was to convene, EPRDF forces
completely surrounded Addis Ababa and other contingents marched further south and
reached Jimma and Gambella, deep in the southwest. In the capital, the army
commanders had no control of their troops, who started roaming around in groups. The
doors of Alem-Bekagn, the capital’s main prison, were opened and prisoners could walk
free. The acting president, General Tesfaye Gebre-Kidan, was in contact with Robert
Houdek, chargé d’affaires at the US embassy in Addis Ababa, to hear about
developments at the London talks and seek advice on how to act amid the deteriorating
situation in Addis Ababa. The London talks were more of a bilateral and consultative
exercise between Herman Cohen on the one hand and the other parties on the other, with
the TPLF and the US suddenly appearing to be on better terms. ‘To any honest observer’,
Tesfatsion Medhanie (1994: 110) noted, ‘there was something strange in the cordial
relations between the US and the EPRDF, which, till some time before the talks, was
espousing the Albanian variant of Marxism-Leninism and ‘Stalinism’’. The next day, 28
May 1991, TPLF/EPRDF forces triumphantly entered Addis Ababa. There was no
meaningful resistance to deal with and this marked the Dergue’s final day in power. After
328spending the night at the American Embassy in Khartoum, the MLLT’s founder and the
TPLF/EPRDF’s leader arrived in Addis Ababa on 1 June 1991 to replace Mengistu Haile
Mariam.
Many factors had contributed to the military success of the TPLF/EPRDF: the
experience and example of insurgent movements around the world, the precedence set by
veteran fighters like Sihul, the strong desire to create an egalitarian society among people
of a marginalized province, a guerrilla army that was highly motivated, taking inspiration
from the history of its forefathers, the successful mobilization of ordinary people, early
victories over rival organizations, the intermittent involvement of the EPLF, and the
growing unpopularity of the authoritarian, deeply undemocratic Dergue government
generating revolt and sabotage across Ethiopia, and even inside its own army. Not only
morale and material support but also the participation of the ordinary people at crucial
moments of the war had emboldened the tenacity of TPLF fighters and other insurgent
groups. Thus the endurance exhibited under harsh battle conditions, the conformity to
centralism and strict discipline maintained throughout the duration of the war were high
compared to the government army. The insurgents considered themselves as liberators of
the Ethiopian people. They had marched deep into the heart of the country, incurring
heavy costs, but had unseated the military regime, and saw themselves as the rightful
rulers to open a new chapter in the country’s history
The TPLF/EPRDF’s Initial Moments in Power
With the nominal participation of the Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement (EPDM)
– that later changed its name to Amhara National Democratic Movement (ANDM) – and
the Oromo People’s Democratic Organization (OPDO) as junior partners in the EPRDF,
the TPLF’s task of toppling the Dergue had come to a successful conclusion. The
President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Mengistu Haile-Mariam, had
fled to Zimbabwe, and the government army was dispersed all over the country. The
329TPLF/EPRDF fighting force automatically assumed the role of a national army under the
command of Meles Zenawi, who had so far shown no commitment to Ethiopian
nationalism. As he ascended to power, the more complex and challenging political task of
governing a diverse society began. Nobody knew which path the TPLF would follow as it
tried to find its way in new political territory. Itself an organization claiming to represent
only one of the over 80 ethno-linguistic groups in Ethiopia, the TPLF was confronted
with the sensitive and complex task of controlling a diverse society with which it had
only limited interaction because of its entrenchment in an ethnic or ethno-regional
programme.
Given the ethnic diversity of Ethiopia and the longstanding emphasis on the ethnic
stance that the TPLF pursued to gain power, there was real concern among large sectors
of Ethiopian society that ethnic polarization and confrontation would emerge and that this
perilous dimension might spoil the country’s entire political environment. With an
authoritarian outlook embedded in its ideology and a triumphant military force under its
command, the TPLF/EPRDF was poised to define the future of Ethiopia on the basis of
ethnicity. Alternative approaches to the post-Dergue political set-up were already
threatened by the sounds of the gun which came with the new power holders. As Kefale
Mammo (2004), former President of the Ethiopia Free-Press Journalists’ Association,
recalls ‘…anybody with a different view from that of the insurgents who called
themselves ‘ethnic liberators’ was labelled ‘remnant of the Dergue’ and therefore should
be hunted down. This war of nerves and the ethnic liberation propaganda were the
greatest preoccupation of the national radio and TV everyday.’ Kibret Mekonnen (2005),
the then editor of Aemero, also attested that ‘by declaring the establishment of [a] ‘peace
and stability’ special force, the TPLF/EPRDF silenced the voices of the civic
organizations and the emerging opposition parties. Ethnicity took on an elevated political
role and people began to look for their ethnic trenches so as to safeguard their interests or
fight back their real or perceived adversaries. When people are pushed to interact on the
basis of ethnicity, extreme and irrational ideas can find fertile ground. As Esman has said
330(1994: 15), ‘The more politicised ethnicity becomes, the more it dominates other
expressions of identity, eclipsing class, occupational, and ideological solidarities’.
Wrangling over Power: Events Leading to the July 1991 Conference
One of the agreements reached in the US-backed London talks in May 1991 between the
TPLF and the OLF was the convening, within a month, of an ‘all-inclusive national
conference’ in Addis Ababa that would establish a Transitional Government to pave the
way for democratic elections. The TPLF and the OLF took the initiative of drafting a
Charter on the basis of which Ethiopia would be administered for a transitional period of
two years. Meles Zenawi of the TPLF/EPRDF and Leenco Lata of the OLF were
responsible for formulating the content of the Transitional Charter and notably the
Eritrean ‘EPLF role in the anticipated transitional arrangement was often defined as that
of a quasi-partner’ (Leenco 1994: 14). He went on:
… the EPLF offered to host a meeting in Sanáfe, Eritrea, in late June, to
prepare the ground work for the July Conference. The outcome of this meeting
was the draft of the Charter, some of whose provisions by indicating a radical
departure from Ethiopian political practice served to raise OLF hopes of
witnessing the beginning of the end of domination.
Thus far, the relationship between the TPLF and the OLF, an armed group claiming to
represent the majority of the Oromo people, appeared amicable, especially in the face of a
political order that had not accommodated diverse views like the one they believed in,
e.g., that of self-determination. Once the old order was gone and the question of power
had to be resolved, it was an open question of how these vanguard and secessionist fronts
would behave towards each other and towards other organizations. Understandably, the
draft Charter would reflect the ideological and political perspectives of the self-appointed
331authors and leaders of their respective ethno-nationalist organizations. Yet the essential
point was whether this Charter would lead Ethiopia through a peaceful and democratic
transitional period that would be acceptable to all stakeholders. Before discussing these
issues, we examine the approach of the leading author, the TPLF, to the idea of
convening a conference to establish a Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE).
As it stood as the major Front, the TPLF took the leading role in designing the
political future of Ethiopia, simply because after it had played a leading military role in
dislodging the Dergue, it found itself in a position to dictate terms. The Ethiopian people,
having endured seventeen years of military dictatorship under the Dergue and seen its
demise in May 1991, understandably hoped things would change for the better and were
awaiting with great relief the political overtures of the victorious Fronts. Indeed, the fall
of the Dergue was seen as the end of tyranny for good, but the general attitude towards
the new powers-that-be was cautious.
After the seizure of power by the TPLF/EPRDF, regarded as secessionist and with
the looming picture of de facto secession of Eritrea under the EPLF, people began to raise
a number of sensitive questions that could not be easily answered. The perceptions of
many Ethiopians were juxtaposed against those of the new power holders, not only on the
Eritrean secession issue but also in relation to its influence on other ethnic nationalities,
on the surrender of all seaports, leaving Ethiopia land-locked, and on ethnic polarization
that was taking a perilous dimension and by some seen as inviting violent confrontation.
Widely and repeatedly raised points included the following issues: Is Eritrea, which was
formerly considered a part of Ethiopia, going to secede without the people being given
the option to decide? Who gave the TPLF leadership the mandate to conclude an
agreement on behalf of Ethiopia? Is Ethiopia going to lose access to the sea and remain
land-locked because of TPLF? Can a force that seized power by the ‘barrel of the gun’
willingly hand over power to the people? Will the new (insurgent) army return to its
barracks or cling on to power like its predecessor and impose its will? Would the TPLF
allow individual, collective and opposition parties democratic rights?
332The relatively freer atmosphere created during the transition period allowed these
views to be aired, and they were reaching those in power, e.g., through the newly
emerging papers and public debates. By many in the leadership such concerns were not
greeted as legitimate questions of concerned citizens, but instead treated as provocative
remarks from ‘remnants of the Dergue intent on causing public disorder’ and from
‘chauvinists’ who were unhappy to see a Tigraian presence at the helm of power in
Ethiopia..
Emerging from years of war in Tigrai, the TPLF leadership was in a dilemma as to
how to construct a government in a country where it had not cultivated any kind of
constituency. More perplexing still was the negative sentiment generated by some of
EPRDF’s unpopular positions. Although forging the EPRDF was, in a way, meant to
create a pan-Ethiopian image for the ethno-nationalist TPLF, this recently improvised
design was doomed to fail as it did not deliver. In fact, people began to label the partners
in the formation of the EPRDF, the EPDM, as the ‘Amharic mouthpiece’ and the OPDO
as the ‘Oromigna mouthpiece’ of the TPLF. Its dilemma was further exacerbated by the
contradiction of its dictum of ‘Grab the commanding heights’, seen to mean ‘Grab power
by any means (see Chapter 8), and mounting pressure from Western powers and donor
countries to follow the path of democracy. The then US Assistant Secretary of State for
African Affairs, Herman Cohen had already warned the TPLF: ‘…no democracy, no
cooperation’ (in Leenco Lata 1999: 134) and ‘…advised the TPLF leaders should be held
accountable on the basis of their declared principles [democratization in this case] and
not merely on improvements registered over that of the Dergue era’ (Ibid.: 22). By
dislodging the Dergue, it was hoped they would provide the freedom the Dergue had
denied the people. That was, in fact, the view of all the democracies that had been on
their side during the struggle. The choices were clear but the situation was not so easy..
As the TPLF had managed to negotiate between ethnicity and Stalinism, it appeared to
choose a similar approach in a modified setting in governing the country. Moves towards
democracy were announced and made, but central control of the TPLF-EPRDF was not
to be relinquished. Support for an authoritarian-led transitional government was found in
333some Western circles, notably the US government, happy with the demise of the
communist Dergue.104 This approach was carefully designed not to embarrass the donor
community, whose aid was crucial for the realization of the transitional enterprise
discussed in London during the peace talks.
With aid from the West in the pipeline and over-confident regarding its military
strength, the TPLF/EPRDF was now poised to dictate the terms for establishing a
transitional government. Since free participation by the people in an open election would,
in all probability, go against the TPLF and jeopardize the realization of its scheme, it was
adamant not to let prominent, long-established opposition groups participate in the
transition process. Even if we assume that the entire population of Tigrai would have
been on the TPLF’s side, the TPLF would have been a loser, for the constituency it
claimed to represent was only about 6% of the Ethiopian population. This inherently
weak position prompted the TPLF to seek other unconventional ways to secure the reins
of government.
The TPLF was now looking for like-minded ethno-nationalists who could be loyal
partners and would follow in the footsteps of the EPDM and the OPDO. From the
beginning of June until the eve of the conference on 1 July 1991, invitations were
extended to various ‘ethnic organizations’ or groups appearing to be such, but those
groups expressing an ‘Ethiopian’ sentiment seemed less relevant. The justification for
this was given by Meles Zenawi who said, ‘People were already expressing themselves
even at the early stage before the conference in terms of nationality: that is manifested in
the way they organized themselves. There were so many nationality-based organizations.
That is a representation of a certain sentiment’ (in Vaughan 1994: 56).. In a country of
more than 80 different ethnic nationalities, where most of whom lived on the periphery of
national politics, the TPLF’s call attracted numerous candidates. Some of the ethnic
group leaders were flown in from Mogadishu and Khartoum, while others were chosen
from remote parts of Ethiopia. TPLF leaders went all out to attract ethnic organizations to
104 The TPLF thus won the blessing of Secretary Herman Cohen and the lobbyist Paul Henze of
Rand Corporation, which opened the doors to US material support. Cf. Henze 1998.
334their new political structure. Revealingly, Sibhat Nega, a TPLF CC member, conferred:
‘We picked organizations from all over – two from here, two from there. One day
Hayelom telephoned from Awassa to say that he had just come across another one.…’ (in
Vaughan 1994: 38). Out of the 27 organizations invited to attend the conference, nineteen
were ethnically based political organizations, five were national political organizations
and the remaining three were civic or professional movements (for details, see Appendix
1). Later on the EPDM was transformed into an ethnic organization, the Amhara National
Democratic Movement (ANDM) and five other ethnic organizations of Agew, Burji,
Gedeo, Kaffa and Yem were included, raising the number of ethnic groups in the council
to 25. This conglomeration of ethnic groups was designed not only to ratify the Charter
drafted by the TPLF and the OLF but also to be the future power base for the TPLF
leadership. No wonder then that suggestions from invitees to the conference and from
scholars like Tecola Hagos105 were ignored. Those suggestions included having
representatives of administrative regions elected from qebele representatives; religious
leaders from all religious groups; representatives of civil associations; representatives
from long-existing movements; representatives from employees of the Ethiopian
government employees; and representatives from associations or unions of employees of
private enterprises.
Only with the alliance of the OLF and the advice of the EPLF could the TPLF
design a charter to realize its plans for ruling the country. As Vaughan pointed out,
‘According to OLF sources, the EPLF was heavily involved in the process which resulted
in the draft document, and the three organizations spent some time hammering out the
details’ (ibid.: 35). It was clear that a charter drafted by ethno-nationalists, the TPLF and
the OLF, with the secessionist EPLF as a compatible advisor, would not be conducive to
the unity of the Ethiopian people – a unity which had created its own cross-current partly
by the history of its evolution but largely because of the ineptitude of successive
repressive governments.

335The July Conference and the Transitional Charter106
In Africa Hall in the centre of Addis Ababa, the invited organizations assembled on 1
July 1991 to review the draft Charter prepared by the TPLF/EPRDF and the OLF. The
gathering was called the ‘Peace and Democracy Transitional Conference of Ethiopia’. As
the conference had been planned and organized by the TPLF/EPRDF, it reflected the
objectives of its leaders. The head of this organization, Meles Zenawi, had no challenger
and became the conference chairman. There was no question about his chairmanship as
the participants were his own supporters, loyal fronts or sympathetic organizations.
Longstanding Ethiopian organizations like the EPRP and MEISON or the COEDF
coalition that could pose a serious challenge to the ethnically charged objectives of the
EPRDF had not been invited. The exclusion of such Ethiopian organizations undermined
a possible mobilization of forces of unity and gave an easy ride to the ethnic fronts that
espoused the secession of Eritrea. By keeping such political forces at bay, the EPRDF
would remain in power with easily manageable forces. ‘In this way, ethnic representation
became wider, but less widely legitimized’ (Pausewang, 2002: 29).
The USA was at the forefront in providing the necessary diplomatic backing for
the Peace and Democracy Conference. Among those who sent observers were the UN,
the OAU, the G7, the US, the USSR, Sudan, Kenya, Djibouti and Eritrea, the latter being
represented by its future president Isayas Afeworki. Although the presence at the
conference of members of the international community gave hope to democratic
participation and a promising future for the conflict-ridden nation, the process was stage-
managed to fit the ideological intentions of the EPRDF. By virtue of its military strength
and organizational capability, it was able to set the agenda and determine the entire
proceedings of the conference.
106 This was a prearranged Charter made by the TPLF and OLF with the consent of the EPLF
before July 1991. The remaining drama in the conference was more of a public exercise to
legalize it.
336In the opening session, Meles Zenawi made his position clear by saying: ‘We need
… a transitional government free of rumour and infighting’ (EPRDF, July 1991). The
statement may seem like normal advice for the participants from the outset but the
context in which it was delivered signified growing opposition (referred to as ‘rumour’)
to the ethnically charged conference and the dominance of ethnic organizations in it as
opposed to pan-Ethiopian orientations. What was labelled as ‘rumour’ was the express
fear among larger sections of the people that Ethiopia was to become an experimental
field of governance based on ethno-linguistic structures, raising concomitant problems of
definition and division. A heated argument came from the Ethiopian National Democratic
Organization (ENDO) on the viability and implementation of the secession of ethnic
groups in general, and that of Eritrea in particular. The discussion was aborted by the
chairman before it went too far. As Vaughan (1994: 53) observed, ‘The conference
chairman’s introduction to the document was direct: ‘it is time to stop playing hide and
seek; it is time that we called a state a state – out of conviction and because of the
objective reality, not out of pressure’ ’. The pressure, however, was already at work –
pressure coated with harsh words from the chairman and his associates in the conference
hall, which in turn based its power on the military force outside the hall. On this very
question, other EPRDF representatives responded in similarly strong terms: ‘This is a
cornerstone of the Charter. If ENDO has reservations on this point, it has reservations on
the core of the Charter. Under these circumstances I cannot accept that ENDO accepts
and participates in the adoption of the Charter’ (ibid.: 51). From here on, conference
participants had two choices: either to agree with the draft Charter as presented by the
EPRDF or to withdraw from the conference. They chose to stick to the former choice, at
least for the time being.
Deliberation about the draft Charter went quite smoothly although nominal
disagreement emerged from a few individuals on issues like ‘the establishment of an
independent judiciary, and whether its jurisdiction would extend to the implementation of
the Charter itself …The EPRDF opposed suggestions that a ‘body of lawyers’ be
appointed for this purpose’ (Vaughan 1994: 50). From the start it was clear that the sole
337arbiters of the Charter were none other than the EPRDF’s leaders. In this way, all twenty
articles classified in five parts of the draft Charter were endorsed as the ‘Transitional
Period Charter of Ethiopia’ (see Appendix 2) and became the ‘supreme law of the land
for the duration of the transitional period’. The Charter ratified the establishment of ‘local
and regional councils … defined on the basis of nationality’ (Article 13) and the right of
Ethiopia’s nations, nationalities and people to ‘self-determination of independence’
(Article 2), i.e. secession. On this basis, an ethnically structured government was formed.
This formal recognition of ethnicity stretched to the level of forging an independent state,
and was a new political structure that would definitely undermine the sense of pan-
Ethiopian identity. In the regional and local elections that were conducted following the
new ethnically based political arrangement, people were ‘required to state their ethnic
identity when they register to vote’ (Tecola 1995: 275). Failure to comply would
disqualify one from voting. By giving legal recognition to people with a single ethnic
identity, the EPRDF proclamation left out people with dual or multiple ethnic identities, a
large group of the population due to its long history of integration. In this case, a new
type of authoritarian system with ethnicity as the cornerstone of state institutions and
governance in the place of the former multi-ethnic institutions was established.107 This
constituted the fundamental provision of the Charter which was the interim Constitution
on the basis of which the Transitional Government of Ethiopia was created.
Representatives of the 27 predominantly ethnic organizations formed a Council of
Representatives (COR) from among themselves to act as a legislative body
(‘Parliament’). This transitional parliament had 87 seats, 32 of which were taken by the
TPLF-led EPRDF with the remaining 55 seats divided among the 23 non-EPRDF
organizations associated to it. At the same time, a council of ministers as an executive
branch was formed, with Meles Zenawi as the President of the Transitional Government
of Ethiopia (TGE). Meles Zenawi then appointed a Prime Minister and a seventeen-
member Council of Ministers. Key posts were given to his party members and the OLF.
107 As D. Turton noted (2006: 10), federalism in post-1991 Ethiopia emerged ‘from the barrel of a
gun’ (and was then introduced from the centre by constitutional fiat).
338As the only independent party, the OLF was the first to be disgruntled with the
power sharing. ‘As early as the summer of 1991 it became clear that TPLF and its
EPRDF coalition did not intend to share power with all the other movements in the
government coalition. The EPRDF member parties were given the local and regional
administrative positions, and based their authority on the presence of TPLF troops’
(Pausewang 2002: 30).
According to the Charter, which became effective on 22 July 1991, a new
constitution would be drafted by a commission set up within the COR and be approved
by the same COR. Regional and local elections were to be held within three months and a
‘Constituent Assembly to be elected pursuant to the final draft of the Constitution’ would
be established. Because of clashes between the EPRDF and the OLF on a number of
issues ranging from election procedures to security arrangements, the election was
postponed several times until 21 June 1992, when it was held in acrimonious
circumstances. There were major challenges from the people about the excessive control
of power by the EPRDF and about its legitimacy. Amid much chaos, it was the EPRDF,
which had more armed troops and cadres than the other parties that turned the election
results in its favour. ‘The struggle between the ruling party (EPRDF) and the opposition
over the control of voter registration and candidate nomination led to the closure of
bureaus (opposition offices), arrests of potential candidates and intimidation of
sympathizers of opposition parties by the ruling party’ (Kahsay Berhe 2005: 111). The
National Election Commission (NEC) had been created by the EPRDF-led COR to run
the election, so it was expected that it would be conducted in favour of the EPRDF. The
Norwegian Observer Group reported that ‘there were also several complaints about party-
officials (of EPRDF coalition parties) carrying out the task of the Election Commissioner
in the absence of a properly appointed Election Commissioner’ (August 1992: 10). In its
own statement, the German Observer Group also concluded that ‘…in most areas
observed, essentially non-competitive, one-party elections were held… conditions were
frequently maintained or created that prevented the opposition parties from equal
participation’ (26 June 1992). Beginning the July 1991 Conference and all the way to the
339June 1992 elections, it was clear the EPRDF had controlled and dominated the political
landscape of the nation, keeping every critical opposition at bay.
Whose Charter and Constitution?
Close observation of the process by which the Charter was formulated and ratified and,
more importantly, the essence of the provisions stipulated in the Charter, clearly reflected
the ideological and political thinking of its founders. There was no escape from this fact
as the TPLF in the name of its umbrella organization, the EPRDF, had seized power and
designed it to be so after toppling the military regime of the Dergue. With the blessing of
the Western powers, happy to be rid of the Dergue, the EPRDF had the opportunity to
fasten its grip on power. In the previous chapters we discussed how the TPLF used the
double-edged ideology of ethno-nationalism on the one hand and Stalinism on the other
to mobilize and control the people of Tigrai in war efforts that brought the political elites
to power. The TPLF saw the dividends of this method of struggle and to remain in power
it chose to pursue with that method in a modified setting. The old ideology was
refashioned in the form of democratic centralism108 and ethno-nationalism and was
expounded as a revolutionary achievement that would release the Ethiopian ethnic
nationalities and peoples from the ills that had haunted them for generations. In the
preamble to the Charter, it was announced that the demise of the Dergue was followed by
the beginning of ‘a new chapter in Ethiopian history in which freedom, equal rights and
self-determination of all the peoples shall be the governing principle of political,
economic and social life and thereby … rescuing them from centuries of subjugation and
backwardness’ (emphasis added by the author). To rule the country de jure, the
TPLF/EPRDF had to transform the Charter into a Constitution (Articles 10-12) as its
main transitional programme. Although it is beyond the scope of this study to discuss the
108 Democratic centralism is Leninism’s basic tenet of organizational rule found in all Communist
parties with strict hierarchical obedience in the execution of decisions coming from above.
3401994 Ethiopian Constitution, I nonetheless indulge in a brief review of its essential tenets
to get a glimpse of the political system that was going to prevail in Ethiopia.
Based on the Charter, on 18 August 1992, the EPRDF-led Council of
Representatives (COR) established a 29-member Constitution Drafting Commission
(CDC) from the COR and elsewhere. The late Ato Kifle Wodajo, a high civil servant and
a close ally of Meles Zenawi, became the chairman of the CDC. A five-day symposium
that lasted from 17-21 May 1993 was organized by a Kenya-based NGO called the Inter-
Africa Group to reinforce CDC efforts. Many international donors, among them USAID,
the Carter Centre, Oxfam US, the Ford Foundation, the UK and Germany, financed the
work of the CDC. Several international scholars, constitutional experts and jurists were
invited to share their ideas with the leaders of the TGE and the Commission. The
majority of the participants were foreigners invited by the TPLF. Civic groups and the
people at large for whom the constitution was intended to serve were not represented.
Mesfin Araya (1993: 31) commented that ‘despite the relevance of constitutional issues
to the conditions of Ethiopian women, workers and peasants, the lack of their
participation in the symposium is inexcusable’. A few of the scholars attempted to inject
ideas into the making of a worthy constitution – a constitution that sets out the powers of
a government and its various organs vis-à-vis the rights of its citizens, in other words,
that defines power relations to bring about harmony and the development of civil society.
Christopher Clapham highlighted the importance of considering the long history of the
Ethiopian society and its intrinsic social values when putting together a constitution.
Samuel Assefa explained the demerits of the right to secession as a constitutional
provision. No matter how farsighted these suggestions might have been and as can be
seen from the contents of the new constitution, they were discounted by the organizing
Commission members who were already tuned to the ethno-nationalist directives of the
EPRDF. Some other scholars and TPLF associates, however, were observed giving their
approval to the ethnically charged experiment. For instance, Mohamed Salih (2001: 196)
wrote: ‘In effect, Ethiopia became the only country in Africa that gives ethnicity an
explicit role in the democratization process’. Whether this was a democratic process or
341not, connotative events were in progress to make it explicit. In fact on another note,
Mohamed Salih indicates how the process itself was tainted with pressures and
manipulation: ‘In 1993, SEPDU [an opposition political formation] split under pressure
exerted upon it by the EPRDF because of its endorsement of the Ethiopian opposition
Paris Conference, which supported the idea of removing the EPRDF government by
force’ (ibid.). Actually, the Paris Conference to which Mohamed Salih refers was a
‘peace and reconciliation’ undertaking and not a project of ‘removing the EPRDF
government by force’109 (see the Declaration of the Paris Peace and Reconciliation in
Ethiopia Conference, 4-6 March 1993).
In November 1993, the CDC published the draft constitution while the EPRDF/the
TGE took responsibility for organizing a discussion forum to explain its content. The
EPRDF declared that the constitution was prepared without commending ‘any particular
style of government or political ideology’ (Embassy of Ethiopia 1994: 1-2). However, the
constitution envisaged by the EPRDF and its drafting Commission reflected its
ideological and political persuasion, which already had its imprint on the Charter. In fact,
close observation of the new constitution reveals that it was eclectically adopted from the
constitutions of authoritarian regimes such as the former Soviet Union, East Germany,
China and North Korea. The core stipulation of power relations, Article 8.1 of the
EPRDF Constitution states that, ‘All sovereign power resides in the nations, nationalities
and peoples of Ethiopia’. This creed is in the style of Article 108 of the former Soviet
Union, Article 66 of socialist Bulgaria, Article 87 of North Korea, Article 62 of Ethiopia
under the Dergue, and Article 16 of the People’s Republic of China which explicitly
states that ‘supreme power resides in the people’s assembly which operates under the
leadership of the communist party’. According to these articles, supreme power is
invariably vested on an assembly of the ‘people’s representatives’ that is controlled by
one party which claims a majority vote by any means. Legislative, executive and
109 The Paris Conference of the Ethiopian opposition parties which was held from 4 to 6 March
1993, was strictly a ‘Peace and Reconciliation’ practical test which the EPRDF turned a blind eye
to.
342judiciary power is thus amassed in the hands of the main party. To make the defined
power relations strictly operative, ‘democratic centralism’ is used as a mechanism of
hierarchical control. In its military structure as a rule and in its political dispensation as a
matter of principle, the TPLF/EPRDF had effectively been employing democratic
centralism and now saw no other mechanism to run the state machinery. In such a
hierarchical power structure, the work of the three branches of state governance
(legislative, judiciary and executive) are directed and controlled by the party which has
the leverage to exercise sovereign power on behalf of the assembly of nations,
nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia. In such vertical power relations, as one observer
said, ‘one can only speak of division of work and not division of power’ (Negede Gobeze
2004: 105). This was evident in the fact that court rulings have been reversed a number of
times by order of the EPRDF leadership. For instance, former Defence Minister Seye
Abraha, who was arrested without due processes of law, after the split in the TPLF
politburo in 2001, was set free by the High Court, but PM Meles Zenawi, the EPRDF
leader who saw Seye Abraha probably as a political rival, overruled the court’s verdict
and ordered his incarceration for more than six years. The case of Aberra Yemaneab, a
former leading member of Meison arrested in 1993 and who used to sign joint
declarations with the current leaders of the EPRDF during the struggle against the
Dergue, is not different from that of Seye Abraha.110 The Prime Minister can pass any
directives including that of going to war through the party structure to his party members
who constitute the majority in the parliament, and in accordance with democratic
centralism he instituted, directives have to be enacted on. A state structure where a party
boss can prevail over the law has been created. The leader of the party that claimed a
majority of the seats in parliament eventually became the supreme arbiter of the nation’s
destiny, due to the party (EPRDF) that submitted power to its Central Committee and the
CC to its politburo, and the politburo in its turn to one person who amassed all state
power in his own hands. This is the process by which monolithic government structures
110 Aberra Yemaneab still lingers in prison (2008). Many such cases can be cited; refer to annual
reports of the Ethiopian Human Rights Council and/or Amnesty International.
343and authoritarian states are created. Tadesse and Young (2003: 401) noted ‘In examining
the role of Meles it can be seen that he has ... accumulated a disproportionate share of
power in the Ethiopian state’. With the enforcement of its party-designed constitution, the
EPRDF dictated the path along which Ethiopia trails. The Constitution poses the danger
of fragmentation on the basis of ethnicity and is not sufficiently conducive to democracy
and peace in the country. The proliferation of ethno-nationalist parties looks to set
continue unabated. E.g., out of the 81 registered parties in August 2002, 73 were ethnic
organizations.111 Basic tenets of one minor force, like the political structure, the economic
programme and the case of nations-nationalities, are imposed as the ‘supreme law of the
nation’. In addition, democratic avenues that could lead to a peaceful transformational
process or to adaptation of the constitutional order seem closed off.112
When we summarize the above developments in the light of the history of the TPLF, we
conclude that from the outset what the incumbency of the TPLF/EPRDF would bring
with it was not entirely unpredictable. The movement began as an ethno-nationalist
organization and later in 1985 within it forged a Stalinist leadership group, the MLLT, to
provide ideological guidance during many years of armed struggle. Its power base was
built up in Tigrai, although in the meantime it may be that ‘Tigray is no longer politically
united, and there has been a clear decline in support from the region, which was the
backbone of the TPLF since 1975’ (Tadesse and Young, 2003: 399). To extend its
political territory to the rest of Ethiopia, it created the EPRDF with its junior partner the
EPDM (eventually ANDM). Later on, other satellite ethnic organizations like the OPDO
and the SEPDF (Southern Ethiopian Peoples Democratic Front) were formed with the
guidance of the TPLF, and joined the EPRDF. The whole idea of organizing, cajoling and
sometimes forging ethnic organizations was to bring as many of them under the EPRDF’s
umbrella as possible and use them to reinforce the creation of the ‘highest organ of state
111 For a list of the registered ethnic and national organizations see APPENDIX - IV

Turton, ed. 2006.
344power’ of the ‘nations, nationalities and peoples of Ethiopia’, as stipulated in the
Transitional Charter (1991) and finally in the federal Constitution (1995). This ‘highest
organ of state power’ allows no division of power but only a ‘division of work’
controlled by one party. That is to say, the presence of the legislative, the judiciary or the
executive branches in the EPRDF-run state of Ethiopia came to signify primarily a
division of work instead of a division of power, as in democratic states. The Transitional
Charter and subsequently the Constitution were crafted to define and reflect this power
ideology. In this manner, ‘as is the case with other political movements in Africa, the
EPRDF has effectively merged with the state, therefore the crisis of the Front is in effect
the crisis of the Ethiopian state’ (ibid.). Such a power structure is the embodiment of
authoritarian governance.
Summary
Although one could maintain that the military Dergue and the revolutionary guerrilla
TPLF espoused basically the same ideology, Marxism-Leninism, yet they were at war
against each other for more than sixteen years until the former was defeated by the latter.
In military terms and just a year before its downfall, the Dergue was much stronger than
not only the TPLF but also all the anti-government fronts in Ethiopia combined. Yet, it
was all the way weak in what matters most to the Ethiopian people politically,
economically and administratively. Among other things, the government of the Dergue
heavily relied on military mobilization accompanied by arbitrary violence to root-out its
ethnic based enemies, conversely the TPLF depended on ethnic mobilization to fight
back atrocities and achieve the right to self-determination; amid this crosscurrent while
the forces of the Dergue were dwindling that of the TPLF was progressively growing.
Other ethnic based forces were also able to sustain the onslaught of the Dergue and
stayed active since the Dergue was alienated from the civilian populous because of its
irrational and violent actions.
345While in general guerrilla tactics proved to be intractable method of struggle of the
weak against mighty governments, ethnic mobilization in particular had definitely created
the conditions for almost all liberation fronts and indeed for the TPLF to grow from a tiny
band of poorly armed combatants into a formidable military force organized into several
divisions. The power of ethnicity had persistently strengthened the Front while the
vengeful actions of the Dergue were only contributing to the growth of the Front by
solidifying the relation between the people and the Front. The fundamental reason for the
defeat of the stronger Dergue by the weaker TPLF lies in the above stated essential
dispositions.
Once the Dergue began descending downhill, there was no chance for a return
despite several attempts of organizational and political reforms. Conversely, the road to
power was cleared for the TPLF although hastily organized negotiations at the last hour
were tried to diffuse the tension, with the involvement of the US and British
governments. The Dergue collapsed in May 1991. As it guided and controlled the entire
struggle, the TPLF political elite with the help of an umbrella coalition of mainly ethnic
organizations, the EPRDF, thereafter continued to determine matters in Ethiopia.
346Chapter 12
The TPLF and African Insurgent Movements: A Comparative Perspective
Introduction
A comparison of the essential features of the TPLF with those of some other African
insurgent movements from the same era can help to better understand the TPLF and
explain the way it struggled successfully to realize its aims: the overthrow of the
militarist Dergue and the establishment of a TPLF-led regime in Ethiopia. From the
beginning, the TPLF had embraced Marxism as its guiding ideology and exercised strict
centralism but at the same time made the most of ethnic-nationalism as a mobilizing
ideology. Its approach to the masses and, in particular, the youth, which was exalted as
the ‘motor’ or essential component of the Front was pragmatic and populist. This
approach helped the TPLF-elite to create ‘movement hegemony’ and empower itself
effectively manipulating the malleability of ethnic-nationalism. Most of the successful
insurgent fronts in Africa seemed to have adopted a similar leftist ideological stance and
had a highly centralized leadership which utilized ethnicity or nationalism with the
attendant vague programs as means of drawing the people to the struggle. The ways in
which these insurgent fronts operated, and especially their relations with the people with
whom or in whose name they waged the struggle and their method of mobilization,
especially of the youth that constituted the bulk of the fighting force, and finally how they
appropriated power, were largely similar.
This section looks into various essential defining features of the TPLF and
correlates them with those of others in Africa. For this purpose, ideology, leadership,
youth mobilization and relations with society (civilians) will be considered to assess how
347these features relate to or differ from those of four other liberation movements of that era
– the Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (FRELIMO), the National Resistance
Army (NRA) of Uganda, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement (SPLM) and the
Eritrean People’s Liberation Front (EPLF). The selection of these fronts is based on the
approximate time span they emerged, the resemblance of ideology – a mix of (ethno-)
nationalism, regionalism and social revolutionary aims. Their conceptualizations of
ethnicity show similarities and differences, and show us much about the uses that their
various political ideologies made of this fact.
The EPLF was geographically and ideologically close to and working with the
TPLF against a common enemy; the SPLM was not far away in geographical terms but
had no working relations with the TPLF. The NRA was further south from the SPLM
area of operation but was a mass-based insurgency movement, in many aspects like the
TPLF, emerging against state tyranny. FRELIMO, on the other hand, as a Southern
African liberation movement was very far away from the operational area of the TPLF
and primarily anti-colonial. Its armed struggle against Portuguese rule was also coming to
the end when the TPLF was starting out, but it had a related socialist ideology and
method of mobilization. In all these case the political elite of the fronts had the upper
hand in defining and guiding the struggle, in swaying the population under their control,
and finally in the disposition of power in their respective countries.
FRELIMO
The Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, FRELIMO, was formed in 1962 in
Tanzania, where an African version of socialism was in the making. The University of
Dar-es-Salaam played a major role here as intellectual centre. From 1964 until 1975,
FRELIMO was engaged in an armed struggle that was popularly known as the ‘People’s
War’ for national independence from Portuguese colonialism. At the same time, it was
carrying out a social revolution in the liberated areas, emulated from other revolutions
348that had waged people’s wars. ‘FRELIMO has undoubtedly drawn much inspiration not
only from China but also from Tanzania’s experiences’, (Munslow 1974: 162) in carrying
out revolutionary nationalism. Early FRELIMO combatants included Samora Machel, a
leader during and after the liberation movement, who did his military training in both
Tanzania and Algeria, where diplomatic activities also took place. The armed struggle
went on for over ten years and resulted in the defeat of the Portuguese colonialists and the
gaining of independence on 25 June 1975, ‘but perhaps of great significance [was] the
social revolution which … ensued as a result of the war’ (Ibid.: 139). Immediately after
liberation, a reorganization of society along socialist lines took place, especially by the
indoctrination of the youth and a nationalization of major sectors of the economy. In
1977, in line with what had been in progress politically, ‘the Third Congress established
FRELIMO as a ‘Marxist-Leninist Vanguard Party’ made up of the ‘best revolutionary
working people’. Its central role was to ensure that politics remained in command’,
(Hanlon 1984: 135).
The NRA
The National Resistance Army NRA in Uganda was formed in 1981 by forces under
Museveni that were first known as the Popular Resistance Army (PRA). Museveni, who
has ruled the country since his victory on 26 January 1986 until today (2008), was first
influenced by the socialist teachings of Julius Nyerere, Eduardo Mondlane and Walter
Rodney while he was a university student in Tanzania. Later he and his radical group
visited FRELIMO-held territories in Mozambique, where they adopted the idea of an
insurgent movement based on the masses and built up a power base from there. As Ngoga
(1998: 94) noted, ‘Museveni was clearly drawing on the doctrines of people’s war that he
had imbibed in the course of his training in Mozambique’. Although Museveni’s political
orientation appeared to be the most left-leaning of the era, he did not commit himself to
the socialist ideology his contemporaries entertained. While almost all political groups
focused on urban activities to pave their way to power, the NRA adjusted its struggle to
349evolve from the rural areas where the majority of the people lived. The NRA’s struggle
heavily depended on the cooperation of the people, who were systematically organized at
grass-roots level. As Museveni (1997: 189) put it, ‘Originally, we had secret committees
of volunteers who banded together as support groups for the fighters, to mobilize food,
recruits and intelligence information’. At the beginning of 1982, committees were elected
in every village to take the place of the secret cells and were renamed ‘Resistance
Councils’ (RCs). ‘The RC system was built upon a pyramid-like structure’, (ibid.) on
which the government was built after the NRA’s victory in 1986.
The SPLM
The SPLM had its roots in the Anya-Nya I, the first southern Sudanese rebel movement
which started in 1955 and continued up to the signing of the Addis Ababa Agreement
with the Khartoum government in 1972. It was a movement opposed to the imposition of
Islam and Arab culture over the Christian and traditional religions of the south by the
dominant northerners, as well as against the gross neglect of the South by the national
government. Total independence on the one hand and effective regional autonomy on the
other were seen as viable solutions to the problem, but these projected approaches were
often sources of conflict among the southerners themselves and that kept the movement
from making significant headway. In 1983, after a decade of uneasy truce, the conflict
flared up again and a Southern political organization known as the Sudan People’s
Liberation Movement (SPLM) was created, with John Garang, from the largest Southern
people, the Dinka, as its chairman. ‘He advocated a united secular Sudan’ (Human Rights
Watch 1994: 20) and ‘autonomous status to various regions within the context of a
United Socialist Sudan, not a United Arab Sudan’ (Scott 1985: 71) but he was opposed
from two prongs: the Islamist northerners as well as the secessionist southerners (the
Anya-Nya II). However, with support from the Marxist military regimes in Ethiopia and
Libya, the then anti-Numeiri government, the SPLM emerged as a formidable military
350front that forced the government in Khartoum to eventually make concessions and
ultimately a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) was signed in 2005.
The EPLF
The EPLF came into being in the early 1970s as a splinter group of the Muslim-
dominated Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) that had been created in 1961. The nationalist
rhetoric and claims for independence from Ethiopia were similar in both cases; yet the
EPLF tried to be more revolutionary than its predecessor, the ELF. The founders of the
EPLF were left-leaning radical elements that made known their revolutionary positions in
a manifesto entitled ‘We and Our Objectives’. They also had a clandestine party called
the Eritrean People’s Socialist Party (Pool 2001: 91) and a programme that reflected its
name. As Markakis (1990: 143) put it, ‘The programme stipulated that the economy of
independent Eritrea would be largely state-owned and centrally planned, land would be
equally distributed, and the peasants would form associations to manage their affairs.
Industry and foreign trade also would be nationalised.’ The top leaders, among them
Ramadan Mohammed Nur and Isayas Afeworki, were trained in China. The nature of
their protracted war against Ethiopian regimes and the social revolution that they carried
on in the Eritrean countryside resembled the Maoist revolution. The EPLF, as it wiped
out its long-time adversary the ELF with the cooperation of the TPLF, managed to defeat
the Ethiopian Dergue regime in Eritrea and declared de facto independence in 1991.
Ideology
Nationalism and socialism of one form or another were the two ideologies that influenced
and shaped all five fronts from the start of their struggles. In predominantly traditional
societies where nationalism had not fully developed and socialism in its revolutionary
form was considered an intrusive concept, the eclectic employment of the two ideologies
351was a new but expedient approach, although in new and unexpected forms. As van
Walraven and Abbink (2003: 27-28) put it, ‘The result is a bizarre combination of
ideological components crafted in the course of struggle in which individuals find
justification for their different agendas’. However this approach served the strategic goal
of the fronts under discussion whose central purpose was to mobilize people with the
hope of a better future and to utilize the mobilized mass force to overthrow oppressive
regimes.
It was quite clear that the socialist-oriented radicalism that swept the world in the
1960s had an impressive impact on the theory of revolution of the leading, active
elements of all the five fronts. As Colburn (1994: 28) put it ‘The linkage between
intellectual trends and revolutions is most apparent in the numerous revolutions that took
place in the 1960s and 1970s. Not surprisingly, the successes of the Chinese, Vietnamese,
Algerian and Cuban revolutions inspired intellectuals in other poor countries’. With some
variation, all had embraced socialism as the just and egalitarian (also at times ‘scientific’)
ideology that would liberate the whole population and bring social justice to the majority
of the working class and peasantry of their countries, if not the whole world under the
banner of ‘proletarian internationalism’. In the context of the parallels drawn between the
Chinese and Cuban revolutions on the one hand and the Ethiopian revolution on the
other, Colburn noted that ‘The most important similarity is the shared use of Marxism-
Leninism to inform the choice of the revolutionary leadership’ (ibid: 24). Only Museveni
(1992: 282) was putting forward the rhetoric of a ‘mixed economy’ strategy. Of all the
fronts under discussion, the TPLF was on the extreme left, forming the MLLT and poised
to emulate socialist Albania. In his interview with R. Dowden of The Independent of 28
November 1989, TPLF leader Meles Zenawi declared that ‘the Soviet Union and other
Eastern bloc countries have never been truly socialist. The nearest any country comes to
being socialist as far as we are concerned is Albania’ (Dowden 1989: 19). Albania was
governed by a socialist system of a Stalinist nature at the time and it appeared that Meles
and his MLLT party were determined to take their ideological dream to great lengths. .
None of the other four fronts in the emerging EPRDF went that far but, in an ironic twist,
352it was again Meles Zenawi who, after seizing power in 1991, quickly seemed to shy away
from Marxist ideology in the original form and embraced ‘revolutionary democracy’, the
content of which is shrouded in controversy.
Since these fronts based their struggle on mass society and their traditional
organizations for their survival and development, they found nationalism an
indispensable ideological tool to mobilize and unite people from different class
backgrounds. A class-based struggle alone was not seen to be effective and would have
led to endless in-fighting. For all practical reasons then, the outlook of these fronts was a
hybrid ideology of one or the other form of socialism and (ethno-)nationalism, geared to
radical social change and revolutionary war. Even the reformist Museveni (1997: 28) had
to declare that, ‘By the time we left the university, quite a tradition of radical thinking
had developed’.
In 1985 when the TPLF became ultra-left-wing by creating the MLLT and
announced publicly that it had adopted Marxism (Stalinist variety) and Albanian
socialism as its model (see Chapter 8), the other fronts then present in Ethiopia exhibited
caution by playing down the revolutionary ideology for fear of inducing a clash of ideas
within the front and with the predominantly traditional and agrarian societies in which
they operated. The NRA in Uganda was at the other extreme, playing things more
cautiously than the other fronts. Also they did not want to provoke the liberal West from
who they sought material support and cooperation for their diplomatic campaigns to
mobilize their own people in the diaspora.
At a secretly held congress with about 100 cadres at Merara, a place north of
Asmara, in 1976, the EPLF formed a clandestine party, the Eritrean People’s Socialist
Party (EPSP). ‘There, they committed the organization to a socialist political program for
the long-term future and a national democratic agenda for the liberation of the country
now’ (Connell, 2001: 356). There was also a secret cadre school where ‘classical texts of
Marxism-Leninism, Stalin and Mao, translated into Tigrinya, were used’ (Pool, 2001:
93). The existence of this Marxist party was unknown until a decision was reached to
dissolve it in 1989, but one could easily observe from the programme and socio-political
353activities of the Front that Marxism was at work. Basically, the ideological alignment of
the EPLF was similar to that of the TPLF, except that the latter made the formation of its
MLLT public and considered the Soviet Union as a social imperialist power. Otherwise,
the EPLF’s National Democratic Programme represented ‘reflections derived from the
revolutionary upheaval that was taking place in Ethiopia at the time’ (Markakis 1990:
143), and which was fed by Marxist-Leninist and Maoist thoughts.
Ideologically, FRELIMO was of a similar Marxist vein, but in its programme it
emphasized the ‘anti-colonial national liberation’ (Dos Santos 1973: 35), and not without
reason. ‘Any attempt to clarify this programme further would have destroyed the unity of
the leadership drawn from liberal democratic … communist and tribalist persuasions’
(Munslow 1974: 141). Failing to consider this problem and by creating the MLLT during
the struggle, the TPLF alienated many people, who were forced to join other fronts, like
the conservative EDU, or abandoned the struggle all together. Yet, towards the end of the
anti-colonial war, FRELIMO expounded the slogan ‘A Luta Continua’ (the struggle
continues) to deal not only with the colonizers but also with their cronies whom they
depicted as ‘class enemies of the FRELIMO’s revolution’ (Vines 1996: 5). To continue
the struggle at a socio-economic level, FRELIMO had to reform its approach and
restructure the organization. ‘At the Third Congress it was agreed to turn it from a mass
movement into a ‘vanguard party’. Although it was to be a Marxist-Leninist Party,
theoretical knowledge or even basic literacy were not criteria for membership’, (Hanlon
1984: 138). As in the TPLF and also the EPLF, loyalty to the revolutionary party was the
crucial criterion of recruitment to the FRELIMO Marxist-Leninist Party. In this manner,
like in the TPLF and the NRA, centralism and a command structure were put in place,
leaving no room for opposition or other political forces – labelled ‘counter-
revolutionaries’ or ‘enemies of the revolution’ – to operate. The so-called ‘mass line’ was
also fading away, and was replaced by the elitist ‘vanguard party’ leadership. The NRA,
however, was not using such Marxist terminology.
Like the TPLF, which started as a highly centralized movement that injected its
ideology into its rank and file members and a limited sector of society, the EPLF was
354advancing in the same direction but discreetly, by creating wahyo (underground cells). In
the NRA, such cells were called secret committees of volunteers. In FRELIMO,
centralism did not follow a strict ideological formation as in the TPLF or the EPLF, at
least not during the armed struggle. FRELIMO was in chaos in 1969 because ‘the
‘tendency’ toward conservative, petty-bourgeois nationalism ran right through the
movement and very far up the apparatus’ (Saul 1973: 191). This was, however, corrected
by adopting Marxist centralism, while the NRA was employing strict military and mass-
line discipline. The SPLM, on the other hand, evolved through a series of factional
debates in which each group allowed the participation of the community and traditional
institutions in which it operated in a bid to gain support. In this process, negotiation,
tolerance and compromise had a chance of gaining ground. This is not, however, to
suggest that the impact of revolutionary Marxism as an ideology of liberation was non-
existent in the SPLM. As Johnson (1998: 53-54) observed, ‘Also in common with the
TPLF/EPRDF and the EPLF, the SPLA has adopted Marxist language in its formulation
of the ‘nationalities’ question as underlying the inequalities inherent in the Sudanese
state’ and it ‘has been revolutionary in some of its language but not in its approach’
(Ibid.: 71). Although the geographic location and the nature of the ethnic divide of
northern and southern Sudan may have been factors to reckon with, the SPLM more
seriously than the other four fronts believed in a negotiated settlement to the conflict with
the Sudanese state and achieved considerable concessions. It did not succeed in
annihilating its adversary, as we saw with the other fronts. Without indulging in Marxist
rhetoric or ‘vanguard party’ formation like the three fronts, however, ‘[the] SPLM …
continued to emphasise Socialism as being the only ideology which can unify a country
of such sharp racial, religious and tribal diversities’ (Scott 1985: 71). With regards to the
content of the SPLM’s socialism, John Garang explained:
… it cannot be determined mechanically and equated with Communism as
Numeiri would like the Western World to believe. The concretisation and
particularisation of socialism in the Sudan shall unfold as the armed struggle
355and as the socio-economic development programmes are implemented during
and after the war and according to Sudanese local and objective conditions.
(ibid.: 72).
In this case, a socialism that perhaps would permeate through the ‘objective situation’ of
Sudanese society and bring self-determination in unison was envisaged as the guiding
ideology of the SPLM.
The pledge of this socialist ideology concerning the aspirations of marginalized
societies was especially attractive to the youth, who sought change, and particularly to
the fronts that claimed to represent the people. It created motivation and gained wide
acceptance during the struggle. Although they questioned its implementation, many
people did not pose any challenge to the ideology as such, and in many instances gave
their tacit endorsement without even attempting to comprehend its content. The severity
of political repression, socio-economic exploitation and often humiliating inequalities of
rank and status that these societies endured under different autocratic systems must have
created a situation that allowed the people, living in predominantly peasant and
traditional societies, to embrace such a revolutionary and radical ideology. Except for the
more radical TPLF and its MLLT party within its own ranks,, the other fronts
downplayed their Marxist rhetoric to gain access to or support from the West, which
allowed them to carry on the struggle on the diplomatic front and mobilize their people in
the diasporas. The NRA was unique in avoiding Marxist rhetoric but consistently relied
on populist slogans like the ‘mass line’ and, as Kasfir (2005: 291) observed, ‘the NRA’s
commitment to egalitarian, non-sectarian, non-coercive popular support came from its
leaders’ analysis of Ugandan society and their involvement with FRELIMO before the
war began’. The radicalism seen in the TPLF, however, was partly indicative of the
limited exposure and the lack of experience of the young TPLF leadership in
international relations vis-à-vis the other fronts.
356Although all five fronts upheld nationalism as a mobilizing and uniting factor, the
nationalist struggle they were engaged in had variations. The nature of subjugation or
repression that respective people felt and the modus operandi and attitude of the ruling
forces would probably have a direct relationship with the variations we observe in the
different fronts. Whereas the TPLF and the SPLM started as ethno-nationalist
organizations and opted for the self-determination of their people within the would-be
democratic nation-states of their respective countries, FRELIMO and the EPLF had
defined their national struggle as an anti-colonial war of liberation and had a programme
of national independence from the occupying regime. The NRA’s nationalist movement
was simply geared to overthrowing a national dictator.
Theoretically, there was the opportunity for the TPLF and the SPLM to coexist
with the once-dominant ruling force in power if the latter allowed the people in question
to determine their right to self-determination. And unlike the TPLF, the SPLM was
attempting to resolve its conflict with the Islamist government along this line. But in the
case of FRELIMO, the NRA and the EPLF, they felt they had to get rid of their occupiers
(or oppressor in the case of the NRA) and run an independent state without the intrusion
of the latter, although for tactical advantage both fronts were at times engaged in
negotiations with their respective governments. In this case, the political education,
propaganda and day-to-day agitation were based on the simple logic and general
assumption that there was nothing to be negotiated with occupiers and once the
colonialists were out and independence had been gained, all social and economic
problems could be solved and the political rights and the dignity of the people would be
respected. Yet, the process of realizing such aspirations was never seriously discussed
during the struggle. If attempts were made by individuals or groups to initiate such
discussions, the leadership of the respective fronts considered them as untimely topics
that could distract the focus of the struggle against the enemy and were subject to
punishment. The demands of the group dubbed Menkae by the EPLF in 1973 were ‘inter
alia, the election of a committee to supervise the actions of the leadership, the
participation of all members in decision making … and similar demands which the
357leaders denounced as anarchist’ (Markakis 1994: 136). The revolutionary nationalists
who raised such legitimate issues were in addition labelled ‘class enemies’ aiming to
destroy the organization, and were thus to be subjected to punishment. David Pool (1998:
25) critically notes, ‘The manqa (menkae) crisis was resolved through the execution of
some of the dissident leaders and recantation through public self-criticism by others’. The
TPLF too took such harsh measures in 1977 against certain individuals – dubbed
hanfeshti – who had raised similar but less coherent discontent that challenged the
leadership. Any form of challenge to the patrons of the unitary ideology was met with a
deadly reaction. Since this ideology did not gain ground in the SPLM and even less so in
the NRA, challenges that might have led to punishment by execution in those fronts were
few in number.
Although this revolutionary ideology had the power to attract masses of people,
among them the youth, the peasantry, workers and all unprivileged classes, in practice, it
remained the best tool of the movements’ leadership to centrally control and command
the very people who sought liberation through it. The revolutionary leadership in almost
all cases was from a small ‘petty bourgeois’ background, an intellectual group that was
able to articulate Marxist and nationalist ideologies to mobilize and lead the social classes
who could not produce leaders of their own. Whether the intellectuals were fighting their
own battle for power or were working on behalf of the unprivileged classes for social
justice is a subject that requires further analysis. The fact remains, however, that this
ideologically inspired struggle was a new approach to seizing power. And more than the
others, the TPLF, by creating the MLLT, made effective use of ideology to achieve its
goal.
Leadership
Leadership in insurgent movements is often claimed or acquired in an unconventional
fashion. Activists in student movements, unions or the army take the initiative to
358challenge an undemocratic state and turn out to be insurgent leaders as the readiness to
bring change broadens. Assessing impatience and seeing people’s tacit or open approval
of their activities, the activists assume leadership of the ensuing movement. In most
cases, such leaders, as Clapham (1988: 9) observed, ‘were drawn from elite sections of
society, as middle-level politicians, army officers or student radicals, and deliberately
decided to pursue an insurgent route to power after alternatives were blocked’. In the
process, the activists often proved to be qualified to be leaders. Often, a group of such
individuals happen to be the founders of an inchoate insurgent movement and simply
assume the leadership where there was none. Most of the movements created in this
manner are then even identified with the leaders. ‘In many cases, the leader and the
movement are so closely associated that it is hard to conceive of one without the other’
(ibid.). The NRA and its founder Museveni are a fine example of such a symbiosis:
‘Yoweri Museveni, who led the NRA throughout the war, was the driving force behind
the construction of the ideology’ (Kasfir 2005: 275). The TPLF leadership was created
through such a process in that the leaders were the same group of student activists who
happened to become founders of the organization and leaders throughout the struggle and
later. The same is true for the EPLF leaders except that they had spent some acrimonious
years with the ELF before they formed their own rival front. Although the leaders in the
NRA, FRELIMO and the SPLM had an intellectual and/or military background and
showed a measured radicalism, the formation of the leadership of these movements was
not qualitatively different from that of the TPLF or the EPLF.
In general, leaders who come to prominence in such unconventional circumstances
stick indefinitely to the leadership position because they develop a sense of guardianship
over the organization they created and usually fail to acknowledge or ignore the
emergence of better-qualified and competent individuals suitable and poised to take over
from them. Leadership in this process becomes the domain of those who came first and
made effective use of ideology to control others. As Colburn (1994: 51) aptly remarked:
359The vanguard role usually played by committed socialists in inciting armed
revolt not only made them the catalysts and linchpins of revolutionary
coalitions, but it also left them well positioned to consolidate power in the
aftermath of victory. Leaders of armed guerrilla organizations almost
invariably have ended up heading the states that emerged subsequent to their
victory. Because it is the guerrillas who ultimately defeat the government’s
forces and seize its institutions, the most viable resources through which
political power can be exercised are at their disposal.
No wonder then that it becomes an uphill struggle and almost impossible to unseat such
leaders. As has been widely observed in the past few years, it has become difficult to
remove Meles Zenawi of the TPLF or Isayas Afeworki of the EPLF or Yoweri Museveni
of the NRA – the so-called ‘new breed’ of African leaders of the 1990s – from power.
John Garang of the SPLM and Eduardo Mondale and Samora Machel of FRELIMO were
removed, though unfortunately only in accidents or by assassination.
The TPLF leadership was relatively younger and less experienced than the
leaderships of the other four fronts and one can observe more revolutionary radicalism,
especially in the ideological rhetoric of the former. All the founding leaders of the TPLF
(except the elderly Sihul who died in the early days of the struggle) were undergraduates
at H.S.I. University in Addis Ababa, while the leaders of the other fronts had higher
degrees in different fields and more past experience. Eduardo Mondale, FRELIMO’s first
president, and John Garang, the chairman of the SPLM, were well educated and highly
qualified leaders with experience acquired in international politics. Ramadan Mohamed
Nur and Isayas Afeworki, both top EPLF leaders, were Chinese-trained leaders and had
extensive field experience which they acquired when they were with the ELF in the
1960s. Yoweri Museveni was a political-science student at the Dar es Salaam University
in Tanzania and had contacts with the African liberation movements that were based
there. He had also worked as Minister of Defence and Minister for Regional Cooperation
before he went to the bush to wage an insurgent movement. On the other hand, the TPLF
360leaders and founders only had revolutionary theory at their disposal and the zeal to
translate this into practice when they headed to the bush of Dedebit to launch their armed
struggle. It would have been a difficult adventure had it not been for Sihul who guided
them through the early days (see Chapter 3).
The early TPLF leaders had no outside contacts of any kind whereas FRELIMO
had established itself in Tanzania and had links with China (Saul 1973) and to some
degree with the Soviet Union. The SPLM had significant outside contacts and received
support from Libya and Ethiopia (Scott 1983); the EPLF had longstanding contacts with
Sudan, some Arab countries and China (Connell 2004; Pool 2001) and the NRA too
received support from Libya in cash and arms (Museveni 1997: 141-42). When the TPLF
started its armed struggle, the only contact it had was with the still relatively weak EPLF,
and in an aberrant way with the ELF, with which it was more often than not in conflict as
it intruded without permission into the operational zone of the TPLF. It was years later
when its military force grew and began attacking Dergue units that the TPLF received
recognition from the Sudanese government, which allowed it to open offices - that were
camouflaged as humanitarian centres for fear of antagonizing the Ethiopian government.
Because of its limited exposure to the outside world and with no contacts to count
on, the TPLF leadership was forced from the beginning to develop in theory and practice
the sense of self-reliance it had gathered from Maoist literature. Its adherence to the idea
of self-reliance, both as a matter of principle and expediency, resembled that of the NRA
which emphatically claimed that ‘the basic weapon of the struggle is the support of the
people and their political consciousness’ (Museveni 1997; Ngoga 1998; Kasfir 2005). As
a result of a lack of practical experience, the TPLF leadership had also had to stick
together to handle the numerous complex matters that arose in the guerrilla movement,
thereby exercising collective leadership in almost every aspect of the struggle.
Since the start of the TPLF’s struggle in 1975 and during the formation of the
MLLT in 1985, the TPLF leadership was strictly collective and no one was singled out as
its dominant figurehead of the Front. Decisions were reached collectively in a series of
meetings, usually through consensus, and executed in the manner agreed upon. The
361inclusion of the formation of an independent Tigrai in the programme known as
‘Manifesto 68’ by the Meles-Sibhat group was a rearguard factional manoeuvre and an
exception to the rule. It was corrected collectively in a matter of days after its emergence.
In the other four fronts, dominant leaders emerged from the beginning: Eduardo
Mondlane and then Samora Machel in FRELIMO, John Garang in the SPLM, Yoweri
Museveni in the NRA and Isayas Afeworki in the EPLF. These leaders all prevailed as
their respective fronts took off. After the formation of the MLLT within the TPLF,
however, its ideologue and founder Meles Zenawi evolved as the dominant leader of both
the TPLF and the MLLT. However, throughout the long period of struggle until the
formation of the MLLT (1976-1985), the TPLF’s collective leadership was so
impregnable that it was not possible to even detect minor political differences in it. This
entrenchment in turn led to a situation in which the leadership was feared and its policies
and directives accepted without question. Except for the symbolic congresses that were
convened and where policy matters were raised for endorsement, all important issues
were settled at meetings of the leadership and then implemented. This was also the case
with the EPLF. The NRA, FRELIMO and the SPLM, on the other hand, had allowed a
level of participation by, for instance, traditional chiefs who had earned a degree of
respect from their respective communities and encouraged partially open debate with the
rank and file. This did influence the decision-making process, although, as in the TPLF
and EPLF, it was the decisive say of the leadership that mattered in the final analysis.
Youth Mobilization
All the insurgent movements invariably and understandably required a young force to
carry the burden of challenging government forces in the battle field. Although it might
appear to be a demanding task, recruiting the youth to the insurgent movements under
consideration was not a major problem. Due to the repressive nature of the often inept
regimes, structural socio-economic problems, and the particular nature of global (Leftist)
362ideological ferment in the Cold War world, there was always a large number of youth,
many of them unemployed, ready for a career in such movements by promises of
meaningful activity and a better future. Orphaned and other marginal children facing a
grim future were also drawn to the movements, although their roles varied. In most cases
they stayed in the base areas and received education, including schooling, political and
military training that prepared them to later join the fighting forces. In some cases also
they were involved in combat. E.g., in the case of Uganda, ‘Museveni was somewhat
embarrassed by the many questions from reporters about his child soldiers, and tried to
play down their role. ‘We gave them guns because they asked for them. We don’t use
them as soldiers.’ But in fact they did participate in the war’ (Furley 1995: 37). As
observed in movements such as Uganda’s Lord’s Resistance Army (Behrend 1998) or
RENAMO (McIntyre, 2005), both of which had gone as far as abducting or kidnapping
children, the recruiting of dissatisfied and unemployed youth had been going on for
years. These recruitment methods were not reported in the case of the TPLF or the other
four fronts being considered here, although subtle coercion when recruiting the youth was
certainly used to some degree.
The TPLF was able to mobilize and continuously recruit youths throughout its
armed struggle with no major difficulties (see Chapter 9). This was also the case, in
general, with FRELIMO, the SPLM, the NRA and the EPLF. Although the process of
recruiting a young fighting force into these Fronts had some differences, fundamentally
they followed the same pattern. What made recruiting the youth so feasible is a subject
that still requires further investigation. In his critical assessment of the situation of youth
in Africa, Abbink (2005: 1) wrote:
They are facing tremendous odds and do not seem to have the future in their
own hands... They also are marginalized in national state policies and have a
weak legal position. African youths are over-represented in armed rebel or
363insurgent movements of various kinds as well as in criminal activities, to
which they are so easily recruited.113
This objective situation, prevalent in most African countries, thus allows the mobilization
of the youth for a struggle that ostensibly mitigates the severity of the situation they were
in, and in fact such situations ‘have led to the massive recruitment and involvement of
youths in revolutionary or insurgent movements, starting in the 1970s’ (ibid.: 12). Many
armed movements, including those of the TPLF, FRELIMO, the SPLM, the NRA and the
EPLF, evolved to become formidable forces by mobilizing youngsters that were caught
in dire situations that it seemed would not easily disappear even after the end of the
struggles. This implies that if new insurgent movements emerge, youths will be available
for membership. We already have seen this in various parts of Africa and Asia, in the
form of diverse social, political and also religious or criminal movements, with ideologies
of mobilization and practices of violence different from those of the 1970s-80s.
Although the youth that voluntarily join an insurgent movement might be inspired
by a host of factors, it has been widely documented that their recruitment to risky
engagements, like guerrilla warfare, indeed requires methods and tactics of persuasion or
coercion. Guerrilla life is a rough and dangerous venture and thus it requires some sort of
propulsion to involve the youth. The TPLF and the other four fronts used persuasion and
coercion as strategic methods of recruitment while they conditionally applied different
tactical approaches. Persuasion was the most widely applicable pattern but coercion was
applied when persuasion failed to yield the necessary number of recruits needed. But
even when coercion was at work, it should not be overlooked that there has been and
would always be some degree of consent as a latent impetus to draw the youth to be part
of a momentum for change.
113 Also because of sheer numbers, their availability, and their eagerness to take up anything that
may relieve them of conditions of poverty, idleness or ennui, youth are easily recruited by
political parties, armed groups or criminal networks (Ibid.: 2005: 3).
364As suggested above, the TPLF by and large had no serious problems in drawing
recruits to the Front and saw no need for coercion in flagrant ways, as was witnessed in
other fronts. Often recruitment into the TPLF was ‘ceremonial’: with village communities
organizing a farewell party in the name of those who were joining the Front. Such a
farewell served as inducement for others to follow, on top of putting the burden of
responsibility on those who had already started the process. These well-planned
recruitment procedures, which gave the sense of voluntary recruitment, were common in
the TPLF, but not in the other four fronts. This does not mean though that sophisticated
ruses and pressure were not employed in the TPLF. For example, peer groups secretly
organized for this purpose played songs at public gatherings that would haunt and
intimidate those who might slip back. In this sense the TPLF was no different from the
other fronts. ‘FRELIMO did the same, sometimes using forced recruitment’ (McIntyre
2005: 236). In southern Sudan, ‘campaigns were undertaken by prominent SPLA/SPLM
members going into the bush to recruit directly’ (Scott 1985: 73) with a show of force.
The EPLF too was using such methods of recruitment but in harsher ways. When the
intensity of the war depleted its fighting forces and the flow of recruits started to dry up,
the EPLF, with the consent of village councils, in some cases rounded up young men in
the villages who had dodged recruitment. The recruits would be told that it was their
‘national obligation’ to join the front and fight the enemy.
Whereas the TPLF emphasized long-term promises of a rosy future under socialist
development, coining the slogan ‘Kalsina newihn meriren, aweta ny'gidine eyu’ (Our
struggle is long and arduous but our victory is certain) and the EPLF agitated for a
prosperous life after independence, FRELIMO and the SPLM, while not ignoring long-
term pledges, were using promises of scholarships and a better life in the movement to
appeal to the immediate needs of the youth. Once they had joined the movements, they
found themselves caught up in the movement and faced with imposed rules of militaristic
hierarchy, often referred to by the Fronts as ‘democratic centralism’, from which it was
difficult if not impossible to withdraw. In the TPLF and the EPLF, resigning or quitting
the Front once you were involved was not a real option. Attempts to leave were
365considered acts of betrayal and would lead to imprisonment, or even execution. In the
SPLM and FRELIMO, on the other hand, the situation was relatively more relaxed. For
instance, the young voluntary fighters in the SPLM could occasionally leave their
barracks to spend time with their families (see Jok 2005), and young students would join
FRELIMO on the understanding that they would receive a scholarship (in Munslow
1974). In other insurgent movements too there was always some kind of enticement to
bring the youth to the front. Sawaba of Niger promised higher education abroad and
access to job and social advancement (Van Walraven 2003), ZANU of Zimbabwe
attracted peasant fighter by promising land and respect for traditional ancestors with the
help of Shona spirit-mediums (Scarritt 1991) and the PAIGC in Guinea-Bissau pledge
‘historical dignity’ and better material life to win allegiance among the rural poor
(Colburn 1994). However, these social relations between the Fronts and their young
fighters lacked consistency.
With reference to the abject daily conditions the youth experienced and by
employing methods of persuasion and coercion whenever applicable, the TPLF and the
other four fronts under discussion were able to mobilize and recruit the youth to their war
efforts. Yet what was achieved in concrete terms did perhaps not correspond to the
sacrifices incurred or match the promises made. No matter how persuasive the call to
engage in the struggle was, it became clear that the end of the war did not guarantee
irreversible positive change for them. It is worth noting that ‘While revolutions are often
about young people challenging old orders, as regimes solidify and age, youth can once
again develop the perception of being excluded and discontent foments’ (McIntyre 2005:
240).
Relations with the Civilian Population
The TPLF and the other four fronts (like almost all insurgent movements for that matter)
laid great emphasis, more often in theory than in practice, on the need to create solid and
366harmonious relationships with ‘the masses’, i.e. the ordinary, civilian population. The
struggle they launched was in the name of the oppressed majority whose active
participation in the movement, as a matter of principle and expediency, was taken for
granted. We have seen above, in one of the TPLF songs, Bahrina, how a fish swimming
in the sea was used as a symbol to represent the TPLF’s positive standing with the
masses. The EPLF named its radio station Dimtsi Hafash (Voice of the Masses). No
wonder then that: ‘All of the literature on insurgent warfare places an enormous emphasis
on the relationship between the insurgents and the people among whom they operate’
(Clapham 1998: 11). This fundamental approach to the relationship was best summarized
by FRELIMO leader Samora Machel who said ‘Our chief strength, the primary cause of
all we do, is the people … In solving our problems we should rely first on them,
following a mass line’ (in Munslow 1974: 144). ‘We are educating our soldiers in
practical and everyday examples that it is the people who matter in this exercise’,
(Museveni in Ngoga 1998: 99).
The idea of the ‘mass line’ was drawn from the doctrine of Mao Tse-Tung who led
the Chinese Revolution based on this theory. Mass line is a theory that stands for the
guided democratic participation of the people from below and believes in the power of
mobilized people to bring about positive political and economic change. In theory, it
appears as a negation of an elitist attitude of vanguardism. The notion of mass line puts
full trust on the pro-active participation of mass society for the realization of social
revolution and its envisaged outcome, such that, as Dos Santos emphasized, ‘if the
leadership starts to back-peddle or divert it will meet the resistance of the masses’ (ibid.:
146). In all cases, the masses tended to believe in or adhere to this ideologically moulded
theory, for they consistently saw, or had not other means of evaluating, the Front as a
whole and the youth, in particular, incurring sacrifices ostensibly on their behalf.
From its inception, the TPLF, using such ‘Maoist’ ideas, appeared to give high
regard to the mass line, though more in theory than in practice, and engaged carefully
with the masses. Tampering with the traditional cultural values of the people it had a deep
association with and that might cause alienation of the Front was considered anti-social
367and liable to disciplinary measures. As Abbink (2005: 19) put it, ‘‘Disciplining’ is not
only a matter of military leadership and internal cohesion but also of the strength of pre-
existing values in the society from which a movement has emerged – religious leadership,
gender relations, strength of the family, etc. – and of the way the insurgent movement has
defined its relations with the civilian population’. Some aspects of the society’s culture
might not have aided the progress of the social revolution as it was envisaged, but that
was tolerated in order to follow the mass line. ‘Live the people’s way’ was a popular
aphorism in the TPLF in the early days of the struggle and members were indeed trying
to live it. This was partly true as far as the material livelihoods were concerned. It was
acceptable and common for TPLF fighters to live the life of the ordinary poor peasant.
Tuning to the aphoristic mass line, there were endeavours to uphold women’s rights,
protect individual or family property, respect religious and traditional values, abide by
community norms and rules, and provide justice whenever and wherever required.
Hitherto marginalized masses thus felt recognized and respected, for this was a
trend they had never seen before. The TPLF’s relations with civilians were by and large
harmonious, with the aim of the struggle being to attain the collective rights of the people
to self-determination. The nationalist feature of the struggle was given prominence,
which helped to strengthen the bond between the Front and the people. In this way, the
TPLF earned the name Widebna (literally ‘our own organization’) and the regular fighters
were referred to as Dekina (our kids). As the other fronts (FRELIMO, the SPLM, the
NRA and the EPLF) followed the same ideological track in mobilizing their respective
peoples, an apparently intimate relationship developed between the fronts and the people
among whom they operated. That the people sincerely hoped for a better future after the
struggle would, in itself, strengthen the bond between the fronts and their respective
peoples.
The causes and conditions that led to the launch of the struggle were essentially
the uniting factors between the insurgents and the people concerned, and the continuous
repressive and military government measures intended to root out the insurgents
reinforced the bond. As Clapham (1998: 14) put it, ‘…there is nothing that so readily
368cements a relationship of solidarity between insurgents and host populations as the
experience of being bombed together’. In all five cases, atrocities committed by the
respective reigning governments did little or nothing to contain the insurgent movements
but increasingly helped keep alive the bond between the people and insurgents to the
extent that sometimes all the people from a village in the NRA or TPLF-held territory
would evacuate to the base area for shelter in the event of government army
encroachment. Such displacement occurred in territories where the insurgents operated
but to what extent such events strictly reflected the bond between the people and the
respective Front is hard to establish unambiguously. The absence of freedom of
expression in the fronts, however, made it difficult to openly discuss the exact nature of
the relationship, and therefore ‘…the mythology of solidarity asserted by the insurgent
leadership cannot be taken at face value’ (ibid.: 15). There were moments when such
mythology was put to the test. In 1985 when the TPLF leadership was confronted with
the choice of focusing on the formation of the MLLT or tackling the worst famine in
recent memory in Tigrai, the leadership chose to assemble all its able-bodied cadres in
the base area in Worie for a month to enjoy festivities and discussions while thousands
were starving.
The rhetoric and practice surrounding the mass line in general drew sympathy and
material support for the fronts from mass society. By propagating the populist banner
more intensively than the other four fronts, the TPLF may have managed to mobilize
substantially more material and human resources for their war venture without having to
resort to aggressive coercion. Yet the other fronts were not far behind the TPLF in this
respect. For instance, it was largely because of the mass-line approach that all the five
fronts were able to outwit rival movements in their respective territories. The TPLF swept
away the Teranafit/EDU from Tigrai, the EPLF drove the ELF out of Eritrea, FRELIMO
outshone RENAMO in almost every aspect of their struggle, the NRA defeated Dr
Kayiira’s Uganda Freedom Movement (UFM) politically, as Museveni (1997: 151) put it,
‘without using any military means’, and the SPLM stood out above the secessionist
groups partly because of the populist mass line they propagated. Finally, they all got rid
369of regimes that were blamed for repressing and exploiting the masses, except for the
SPLM that had to settle for negotiated concessions.
Summary
Although situated in varying geographic and cultural circumstances, the comparative
study of the four liberation fronts (EPLF, FRELIMO, NRA and SPLM) vis-à-vis the
TPLF nonetheless underscores basic features related to revolutionary ideology, dominant
leadership and mass mobilization. In light of this comparative exposition, it is compelling
to conclude that developing countries’ ethnic or nationalist liberation movements of the
revolutionary era of the 1960s and 70s by-and-large espoused Marxism-Leninism as their
guiding ideology and Maoist revolutionary guerrilla warfare – also known as ‘people’s
war’ - as their best method of struggle. As the main purpose of revolutionary warfare is to
supplant existing government (Sarkesian 1975: 7), a combination of activities including
socio-economic, political and psychological warfare was applied to mobilize the people
according to age, sex, occupation and even religious affiliation, without whose
participation the elite driven plan would not have materialized. Utilizing the malleability,
fluidity and power of ethnicity wherever applicable on the one hand, and by articulating a
fusion of ethnic and class interest in rhetorical theories on the other, the fronts were able
to effectively mobilize their respective masses of people against the governments.
Alienated and denied of legitimacy and support from the people they used to govern, the
governments, short of mechanisms of persuasion, were resorting to acts of reprisal that
only worsened their relations with the people. In this unconventional confrontation, the
revolutionary guerrilla movements/‘liberation’ fronts were able to become formidable
forces.
After the defeat of the government armies, the leadership of the victorious fronts
took over and continued to remain in power, in most cases indefinitely. The leaderships
of the EPLF, NRA, FRELIMO and TPLF are cases in point. The rhetoric of socialism,
370egalitarian society and economic progress proved to ambiguous, often not applicable, and
thus actual transformations of governance ideas, democracy, egalitarianism, equitable
economic development, etc. were only partly successful, and in some case deceptive. If
revolution, as Colburn (1994: 105) puts it, ‘…defies not just established political and
economic realities, but also the petty calculations of interest and advantage that comprise
so much of every day life’, then what those liberation movements brought forth were far
from it. The main feature of each movement’s outcome was regime change at best, or in
other words, the replacement of one group of political elites by another. The history of
the TPLF demonstrates this reality, despite the major changes it wrought in the post-1991
political and economic structures of Ethiopia.
371General Conclusion
This thesis was an attempt to contribute to the historical study and explanation of an
ethno-nationalist movement which emerged in 1975 rose to power in Ethiopia in 1991. It
gave a critical, retrospective analysis of the political history of the Tigrai People’s
Liberation Front (TPLF), the de facto ruling party in today’s Ethiopia under the name of
the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). The study began by
explaining the political and social conditions under which the TPLF emerged, how the
armed struggle started, and how the mobilization of the people took place. I also dealt
with the background to the conflict between the various ethno-regional liberation fronts
and other revolutionary groups and the military government that took power in the wake
of the overthrow of the imperial government of Haile Selassie I in 1974. A core issue in
the revolutionary turmoil of those days appeared to be the developments surrounding the
issue of ‘national self-determination’ and how it was conceptualized at the various stages
in the TPLF’s struggle. The study went on to explain the nature of the TPLF’s
relationship with the various warring parties in Ethiopia as well as with the EPLF in
Eritrea and the way in which the revolutionary elite of the TPLF leadership staged the
‘vanguard of the revolution’, namely via the Marxist-Leninist League of Tigrai (MLLT)
as an important instrument to gain power and redefine the movement. It finally narrated
how the TPLF captured power in 1991, and I then moved on to a comparative analysis of
the TPLF and four other nationalist movements in Africa. It is on the basis of this
analysis that a few concluding remarks will now be made.
The social and political conditions in Tigrai in the 1960s, and by extension,
Ethiopia at large, from which the TPLF emerged, were characterized by rampant poverty,
political repression, autocratic rule and ethno-regional and ethno-linguistic disparities.
However, the interpretation of this situation that was politically ethnicized at one point
and ideologically charged at another need to be revisited and to engage the TPLF’s
372current official historiography as well as several scholarly efforts made to this effect.
Tigrai, like the rest of Ethiopia, experienced a grinding poverty that reduced the people to
what Frantz Fanon once called ‘the wretched of the earth’. In addition, political
repression by the autocratic government of Emperor Haile Selassie suffocated political
and economic change and generated deep unrest among the population, notably the
emerging educated strata (students, teachers, civil servants). In the aftermath of the
liberation of Ethiopia from Fascist Italian rule in 1941 and in the light of high
expectations of post-war restoration of order, there was a first rebellion in the greater part
of Tigrai in 1942-43, the Woyyane rebellion. It was a precedent in the history of the
country and created a regional consciousness and an ‘example’ of the sort that was
carried over to the young generation. The founders of the TPLF had this consciousness as
part of their background when they started to confront the military regime of the Dergue,
although they developed different ideals. The rising tide of the Ethiopian student
movement of the 1960s, that was Marxist through and through, also had a huge influence
on the pioneers of the TPLF. As a result, theirs is a case that appears ideologically a
fusion of Marxism and ethno-nationalism, emerging in a time of ideological upheaval on
the national political scene. This was reflected at times of schism or critical moments in
the history of the TPLF. The two major shades among the pioneers were, therefore, those
who saw their movement as part of a national struggle by the Ethiopian people against
autocracy and repression (represented by Sihul, Giday, Aregawi and, Teklu, among
others), while the other shade resorted to a more ‘parochial’ orientation of ethno-regional
exclusiveness (represented by Sibhat, Meles, Abbai and Seyoum).114 By resorting to the
elusive idea of self-determination, which included secession from Ethiopia and the
formation of an independent Republic of Tigrai, essentially like that of the EPLF in
Eritrea, the latter wing exploited the fluidity of ideas of ethnic identity and ‘ethno-
national self-determination’ for its own ends. Since ‘ethnic identity is often being used to

executive committee or the broader ‘leading elements’ group and who eventually rose to the
executive level.
373construct differences that were not there before’ (Abbink 1998: 60) or ‘conveniently
forget realities that have existed’ (Roosens 1989: 161), ethnic exclusiveness was
stretched to the extreme (as later reflected in the 1995 federal Constitution of Ethiopia,
created under the aegis the same ethno-regionalist elite).
The historical irony is, however, that the parochial wing of the TPLF shifted its
position once it had purged its rivals among the pioneers and claimed to be the champion
of the pan-Ethiopian perspective, by forging the EPRDF. This was concluded around mid
1990, with the impending fall of Addis Ababa to the TPLF’s final offensive. This shift of
position reinforces the contention of this study that ethnicity serves as an ideology of
mobilization or collectivises for political ends that may be resolved within or outside a
given state, and that the elite, by claiming to represent the cause of the people but often
running after their own power interests, play a decisive role in dictating the mobilization
process. In the first place, envisaging the idea of Tigraian secession, an entity that
constituted the historic core of the Ethiopian nation, was a questionable, if not delusive
claim. In general, theoretically the grounds for secession from existing states are tenuous,
and in constitutional theory recognition of an absolute right to secession is not common
(see Buchanan 1997). The shift towards secession thinking by some in the TPLF was
influenced by political events on the ground rather than by a change of ideology. The
military government’s victory over Somali forces in the 1977 war reverberated so quickly
that its major protagonists in Eritrea resorted to a tactical retreat from the towns they had
held since 1975. Pressure from the EPLF on the TPLF leadership to form a coalition with
other fighting forces inside Ethiopia came at this time with a group calling itself the
Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement (EPDM, a splinter group of the leftist urban
guerrilla group EPRP) emerging on the scene in the Gondar region. Later in the 1980s,
this EPDM formed a ‘united front’ with the TPLF in the shape of the EPRDF (Ethiopian
People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front). This was a case of an ideological shift
towards pan-Ethiopianism by the TPLF sub-group prompted by political expediency
rather than conviction. It was made possible by the dual heritage of the Ethiopian student
movement, which was inspired by both socialist thinking based on a national, class
374analysis and on ethnic/ethno-regional thinking, stimulated by the Eritrean question, seen
as a national/colonial question. This basic ideological ambivalence continued in the TPLF
leadership in the years that followed.
On the ground during the struggle, the political message used to mobilize the
people of Tigrai was mainly that of ethno-nationalism. In the historical sense, ethno-
nationalism poses a dilemma: is it only a convenient agenda or means of mobilizing
people that did not have developed class and national identities, or can it be the basis for
nation-wide political solutions to inequalities, etc. in federal or other form? Two factors
are important here. On the one hand, there is often the oppression of a given community
as a reality, with the ethnic exclusiveness of the dominant ethnic group(s) to rationalize
that oppression. Ethnic exclusiveness may in such cases often be concealed, as Juteau
(2004: 96) observed:
When dominant groups reject ethnic labelling, even with the best of
intentions in the name of equality, they are involuntarily hiding their own
ethnicity from themselves. This allows them to define their organizations,
their culture, their nation as non-ethnic, and to impose their ethnicity on to
others, often under the guise of universalism. Furthermore, this omission
masks the very process through which majorities conceal their ethnicity.
Juteau’s observation largely applies to the dominant Amhara ruling elite the TPLF was
fighting to unseat, but it could be said that ‘[w]hat the Tigrayan elite has been trying
since 1991 is a historical parallel of what the Amhara elite tried in the second half of the
19th century – the creation of Ethiopian unity [minus Eritrea] such that its own dominance
is assured’ (Merera 2002: 191). In the TPLF case, the guise of universalism is ‘ethnic
federalism’ as opposed to a unitary state.
On the other hand, there is the question as to whether or not ethno-nationalism
with self-determination in the form of ethnic-based federalism, seemingly pursued by the
375TPLF and the current Ethiopian government, is by its very nature and complexity a
workable alternative.
As far as the first point is concerned, the big question was (and is) whether or not
the form the oppression that the people of Tigrai were experiencing to was indeed only
‘ethnically based’ and exclusively against their language, culture, etc. and was exploiting
Tigrai’s ‘resources’. Or was the rule and hegemony by a Shewan-Amhara-led elite
(notably in imperial Ethiopia) the standard form of oppression that was found among the
other non-Shewan-Amhara ethnic groups? It seems that Tigraians were not oppressed in
the exclusive sense as the TPLF Manifesto of 1976 claimed. Its assertion that ‘…the
Tigraians have been made to be the most hated, suspected and discriminated people in the
empire, thereby making harmonious life absolutely intolerable’ (TPLF Manifesto,
February 1976 E.C. 20) was rather extreme. As always, the way the oppression was
interpreted mattered a great deal, particularly in view of a search for alternatives. Because
the Manifesto claimed that the oppression against the people of Tigrai was exclusive, it
formulated the predicament in the form of what in Leninist discourse is called ‘national
oppression’ (of a people or ‘nationality’), and secession was then thought to be the
solution. Despite this view, John Young, who conducted extensive research on the TPLF
in the 1990s, believed that the ‘…establishment of the TPLF did not mark a retreat into
ethnic parochialism’ (1997: 32). This assertion misses the essential issue of the ‘ethnic
self-determination up to secession’ on which the TPLF-led EPRDF political structure was
constructed and was expanded beyond the Tigrai people into other ethnic regions’ of
Ethiopia. Also, Young contradicts himself when in a follow-up remark in the same work,
he states that ‘[n]ationalism was critical to the success of the TPLF’ (ibid.). Ethnic
nationalism is, after all, the politics of distinctiveness and self-rule in a particular
homeland in which case the internal ‘we’ must be distinguished from the external ‘they’
(see Esman 1994), and it is also a suitable tool of mobilization to be manipulated by the
left as well as the right, by the secessionist as well as by the ‘unionist’, by the religious
extremist as well as the atheist, and so on. In fact, the oppression in Tigrai was no
different from the oppression characterizing the masses of the other ethnic groups in
376Ethiopia. And the way both the imperial and military governments resorted to quelling
the rebellions in the different parts of the country (Bale, Gojjam and Eritrea for instance)
was of the same militaristic nature with the measures taken in Tigrai.
The TPLF leadership put forward ethno-nationalism with ‘self-determination
including and up to secession’ as its principal goal mainly because that stood the best
chance of building an effective fighting force that leads to power, which understandably
is the elite’s own cause. The self-determination agenda advanced to mobilize the masses
of Tigrai was not largely adhered to by the people; on the basis of their historical
experiences and achievements they even strongly believed that they were not only just
Ethiopians but that they constituted the core of Ethiopia’s ancient civilization. The
disparity between the self-determination agenda and the inherent pan-Ethiopian
aspirations of the masses was high. Tigraians generally, in their religious or cultural
ceremonies, reflected their loyalty to the Ethiopian nation. But with the largely peasant
society of Tigrai appeared to have ‘accepted’ the self-determination enterprise, partly
because they came to believe in the promises of socio-economic transformation
programmes and in the liberation from state oppression, and partly for fear of reprisal or
coercion of the TPLF if the mobilization process would be opposed.115
If the Tigraian masses had not bought the TPLF’s self-determination agenda, what
would that have made of the movement? Was it a social revolution, a people’s movement
or a movement in the service of the political elite? Let’s begin with social revolution. A
social revolution first of all constitutes a radical process that negates the status quo ante,
characterized by a political overthrow of the ancien régime and its replacement with a
popular power that follows thoroughly transformative political, social and economic
programmes. After all, ‘there have been revolutions as long as there have been systems
against which to rebel’ (Lipsky 1976: 494). For the TPLF movement to be dubbed social
115 A sign of this disparity of attitude was expressed in 2005 when in the parliamentary elections
most of the residents of Addis Ababa of Tigraian origin (encouraged by the presence of
international observers, diplomats and the media) voted for the opposition, denying the TPLF
even a single parliamentary seat in the capital’s council. One might speculate that in Tigrai many
more people might have done the same had there been the chance of a free election.
377revolutionary requires the fulfilment of such conditions. Indeed, there were
‘revolutionary’ slogans and moves on land reform, women’s rights and participation of
the people in self-administration. However as important as realizing change – much of
which remained short of consummation - such measures were meant to induce and
mobilize the people to primarily support the war rather than improve their lives or
empower them.116
The second major element that could have made it a revolutionary power is the
issue of democratic governance which needed the state’s role to be that of regulating
rather than ruling/dictating, as the military regime had earlier done. The TPLF’s
perception of governance already during its time in the struggle is the well-known
Leninist concept of the vanguard. The theory of the vanguard allows no room for
participation of the sector outside the ruling party, which has the role of monopolistic
decision-maker for the masses, the civic movements and opposition organizations. After
1991, the space for the non-party political sector that had existed in Ethiopia was allowed
mainly due to the complex heterogeneity of Ethiopian society, a lack of constituency
outside Tigrai that necessitated tolerance, and the donor countries’ pressure to open up.
Without changing its role of ruling/dictating, the TPLF experimentally allowed space for
media freedom, opposition parties, civic groups and local NGOs to participate in political
life, while keeping a policy of ultimate authority towards them when it came to essential
policy matters. But a competitive democratic system was not developed, as it would
endanger the EPRDF’s comprehensive programme for Ethiopia and their hard-won
116 A given power cannot be labelled ‘revolutionary’ without comparing it to the nature of the
power of the regime it overthrew. The anti-thesis to power under the Dergue military government
that the TPLF overthrew should have been a broad-based, all-encompassing government and
legislature in the first place. Instead, the TPLF seemed to resort to a double-edged policy, namely
the exercise of power exclusively by the party but pretending that state power was open to
contest. The litmus test came in the May 2005 elections, when the people of Ethiopia made a
strong vote against the TPLF/EPRDF and favoured the opposition parties (Coalition for Unity
and Democracy, the United Ethiopian Democratic Front, and the Oromo Federal Democratic
Movement) to an unprecedented degree. For instance, all the 23 parliamentary seats for Addis
Ababa, as wel as the mayorship, were won by the opposition. Also in the countryside the vote for
the opposition was huge, and a great shock to the EPRDF/TPLF. In the end the EPRDF was
declared the winner, but the counting process was intransparent and suspicions remain that they
may have lost in actual votes.
378power and privilege. A substantial literature by both journalists and academics shows that
the essentials of governance in Ethiopia since 1991 have not changed, and in fact have
led to a rooting of dominant party rule across the country. Here one can see an almost
seamless continuity with the pre-1991 period and the ideology and control practices of
the TPLF/EPRDF then pursued in its route to power. Most freedoms were retracted in the
past decade, and political and economic control reasserted.117 In all, the case can be made
that the TPLF, far from being a mass revolutionary movement, actually turned into a
parochial movement of a section of the Tigraian elite.
The claim to be ‘revolutionary’ has been reiterated in a much more elaborate
fashion in the formula ‘revolutionary democracy’. This concept is essential for an
understanding of the TPLF and current politics of the government. It has been developed
since ca. 1990 and its role came out clearly during and after the purge of a section of the
TPLF’s top leadership and, by extension, of the EPRDF leadership in 2001, (Paulos
Milkias 2001; Tesfay Atsbaha and Kahsay Berhe 2001). Until then, the TPLF had played
down its self-appointed revolutionary credentials and there was no more mention of
Marxism-Leninism or indeed of the MLLT. During the leadership crisis of 2001 that
emerged after a serious split over the war policy toward Eritrea and macro-economic
policy, the TPLF opted to appear more ‘revolutionary’ than the ‘nationalist’ faction that
was purged, partly because they were portrayed as a ‘sell-out to US pressure’. In a 2001
document that became a government directive, the Front rejected liberal democracy as
unfit for Ethiopia on a number of grounds and argued that the EPRDF had opted for what
it calls ‘revolutionary democracy’.118 According to Meles Zenawi, because the
TPLF/EPRDF is ‘supported by the peasantry’, it represents primarily their interests, and
because Ethiopia is predominantly rural, the EPRDF therefore represents the interests of
the majority of the population. It alleges that this aspect makes it democratic, while its
117 Opposition parties were often intimidated by the government, NGOs and civic groups have
been closed down or their activities curtailed, numerous journalists from the private media have
been jailed, and thousands of refugees have fled to neighbouring countries.
118 See official documents of the EPRDF, ‘The Development Lines of Revolutionary
Democracy’, Addis Ababa, 1992 E.C., and ‘Fundamental Questions of Democracy in Ethiopia’,
Addis Ababa, 2001.
379‘radical’ policies give it a revolutionary content; hence, the claim for ‘revolutionary
democracy’. This is the Leninist concept of ‘the vanguard’ turned inside out. But based
on the widely accepted definition of revolution we saw above, it is hard to characterize
the TPLF as revolutionary. In addition , for ideological reasons the TPLF is estranged
from democracy as a system of representative and accountable government even with
regard to the peasantry it claims as it constituency – because these have no independent
say in matters.
As to the question of ethnicity and ethnic politics – that was the cornerstone of
TPLF’s political reforms after 1991, and which led to the institutionalization of an ethnic-
based federal system, with regions and districts based roughly on ethno-linguistic lines.
The discourse of rights and democracy is couched in terms of the ‘nations, nationalities
and peoples’ of Ethiopia – to do justice to its diversity and to the claims of the various
peoples. Democracy in this model is equated autonomy and (in principle) self-
determination with secession as an option if groups are not happy in the federation. The
model has been widely discussed and it will not be pursued here except to relate it to the
history of the TPLF and its ideologies as sketched in this thesis.
Ethiopia has a significant ethnic heterogeneity, with about 80 language groups.
The TPLF had its social base only in Tigrai. As a ‘mono-region’ movement, controlling
the whole of Ethiopia with its different groups and regions after the fall of the military
regime carried great risks and challenges. There were a number of other opposition
political groups claiming their stakes and it was necessary to bring about political
stability as soon as possible. EPRDF forces were already met with opposition
demonstrations after they entered the Addis Ababa on 28 May 1991 because their
policies on a host of national issues were not seen to reflect nor be open to the concerns
of people outside Tigrai. Scepticism towards the TPLF/EPRDF was widespread.
Once in power, the TPLF devised a political system based on ethnicity seen as the
only suitable way to implement ‘revolutionary democracy’ and ensuring its rule.
Refashioning Article 2-c of the 1991 Charter, it had Article 39 adopted in its 1995
Constitution: the right of nationalities and peoples to a self-determination, which also
380included the right to secede and form an independent state. Ethnic federalism on the basis
of ethno-linguistic identity was the formula. But it was contested and carried risks. As
Clapham (2004: 53) observed, ‘This redefinition of Ethiopia along ethnic lines has
created conflicts of its own, especially over demarcation of territories’. It was also noted
that ‘Most importantly, the Constitution has tried to reify, to freeze something which is
by nature fluid and shifting: ethnic identity’ (Abbink 1997: 172). It could be contended
that the whole idea behind Article 39 was to set up a new mechanism of control
(Clapham 2004; Melakou Tegegn 2004; Merera Gudina 2000). To this end, a number of
‘ethno-national organizations’ were set up such as the Oromo People’s Democratic
Organization (OPDO), the Southern People’s Democratic Organization (SPDO)119 and
the Ethiopian People’s Democratic Movement (EPDM), the TPLF’s erstwhile partner
that formed the EPRDF, which had to change its name to the Amhara National
Democratic Movement (ANDM), suggesting that the EPDM had never been independent
in the first place and was adhering to the new ethnic politics of the TPLF. These were
categorized as ‘People’s democratic organizations’ (PDOs) which in many cases ‘…were
led by ambitious individuals who had been based in Addis Ababa or even abroad, and
had few evident links with their regions of origin’ (Clapham 1995: 88). With the
formation of PDOs in its orbit, the TPLF was able to extend its party and state
structure120 to all ethnic groups in the country.
Like the TPLF, these PDOs also had to have their own Marxist-Leninist vanguard
core. These were established later on although the ANDM had earlier formed its own.
The Marxist-Leninist nuclei are actually the elite core with actual power in the new
regions. These nuclei have also formed a central fortress at the national level to lead the
EPRDF, with the TPLF as dominant. What is seen in Ethiopia now is a cumbersome
structure of governance where the party (EPRDF) and government structures overlap and
119 Later also known as Southern Ethiopian People’s Democratic Front (SEPDF).
120 The TPLF/EPRDF has expanded its party/state structure to the other regions in the MLLT
fashion. This structure stretches down from the qebele which was the lowest during the Dergue
era and now divided into 3 or 4 nu’us (sub) qebele, then each nu’us qebele to 5 or 6 gott’ or
kushet and finally each gott’ constituting 30 or 50 households called mengistawi buden or m.
gujile. At each level there are three party/state representatives assigned to work as administrators.
381sometimes clash. However, in the light of the former MLLT ideology, this is the best
structure to guarantee control over society where they never had much constituency in the
first place. The MLLT unofficial network takes major decisions and its sub-sections (the
TPLF, OPDO, ANDM and other PDOs) are expected to follow suit and implement them
without question. Officially though, TPLF politburo decisions are passed down to the
EPRDF politburo, itself TPLF-dominated, for formal approval and then passed down to
ministries, the non-independent court system and the PDOs in the regions for
implementation (Aklilu 2000a; Aalen 2000a; Merera 2002: 150).
The ruling party’s grand plan after 1991 was to proceed with forming Marxist-
Leninist nuclei within the ruling parties in what it calls the ‘backward regions’ such as
the Somali region, Afar, BeniShangul-Gumuz and Gambela and bring them into the party
fold, paving the way for a grand coalition at EPRDF level.
We thus see that not unexpectedly the ideological and organizational structure of
post-1991 Ethiopia has emerged quite directly out of the TPLF experience before its
taking power. Its political ideology of rule, based on ‘revolutionary democracy’ and
ethnic-based federalism is an updated adaptation of Leftist ideas and Marxist-Leninist
models in the political sphere, combined with a more liberalized economy, in which
though the party and the state have a dominant role.121
Although clear data on the opinions of people are difficult to get, indications are
that the TPLF approach to governance – both as to its authoritarianism and its
ethnicization policy - is decreasing in popularity among the wider public. According to
domestic and foreign observers, conflicts are frequent, ethnic group relations are tense,
religious antagonisms grow, complaints about suppression of (political and human) rights
and police and army over-reaction are a cause for concern,122 and economic favouritism
and corruption are lamented widely.
121 The ruling party (and its affiliates), through private limited companies headed by party
members, controls key sectors of the Ethiopia economy – banking, production, publishing,
building, and import-export trade.
122 This was most evident in the wake of the controversial general elections of 2005, leading to a
wave of arrests, street killings, and dismantling of opposition forces. This violence was criticized
382One of the TPLF’s survival strategies has been to invoke the malleable material of
ethnicity and ethnic nationalism. It claims that if the opposition takes over or wins power,
the entire people of Tigrai will be doomed as a result of ethnic discrimination and
hegemonism, if not worse. But this scenario is also a political ploy, more to stimulate the
EPRDF’s policies of language-based ethnic federalism than by a danger posed by the few
countervailing forces123 As a rule the difference between the political elite and the
ordinary Tigrai people is made and people focus on common underlying problems cross-
cut the ‘ethnic problems’.
As ethnic mobilization was the TPLF’s means to seize power, it now appears that
the ethnic polarization being created as a result is threatening the state power structure
and national cohesion. There is insecurity about sharing on national agenda, mistrust
against the government and other ethnic groups, many times irrational (political and
economic) competition, and a new dynamics of ‘we vs. them’ conceptions. On the other
hand, recent studies revealed that, perhaps sceptical towards, or dismayed with what
ethnic politics has brought to them, more people are becoming defiant of ethnic
categorizations that tend to overgrow notions of Ethiopian identity. New research after
almost a decade the TPLF/EPRDF seized power was conducted where respondents from
14 ethnic groups were given ‘the question and choice of whether they were primarily
members of their specific ethnic group, Ethiopian, or neither of the two. It was found that
80% of the participants reported primarily ‘being Ethiopian’. Only 17.5% opted for being
primarily a member of their respective ethnic group and 2.5% preferred neither of the
two’ (Habtamu Wondimu 2001: 25). In his critical remarks on the Oromo nationalists
in the first report of a special Inquiry Commission, set up in 2006 by the government. Its report
was unexpectedly critical, subsequently repressed and forcibly changed. As subsequent events
have shown, indications are that even in the home region of Tigrai – where opposition parties had
a very hard time to campaign in the 2005 and 2007 election campaigns or even to be tolerated –
support for the TPLF is declining.
123 Only a few ‘extremist’ forces exist and have no adherence within Ethiopia. One is the
Oakland-based ‘Ethiopian Patriotic Front’, which in its programme dated 7 May 1994, Section 2,
Article 4/a, stated that ‘anyone born into or related by marriage to the Tigraian ethnic group can
not be a member’. People question whether members of this extremist group can be called
Amhara patriots or Ethiopian patriots. The group’s ideas have been condemned widely by all
concerned Ethiopians and now-a-days it does not effectively function.
383whose position is not far removed from that of the TPLF, Merera Gudina (2002: 5) tends
to corroborate the above findings when he wrote: ‘The Southern Ethiopian ethnic groups
and the multi-ethnic forces whose platform is to struggle for democracy and Ethiopian
unity are not happy with the Oromo perspective either’. The realization of the pitfalls
accompanying ethnic politics may, however, lead the nation eventually to forge a rational
design where diversity becomes a more balanced building block of wider unity in a
system that combines respect for the facts of diversity and the politico-economic needs
for a workable unifying framework in a less ethnic federal form that would discourage
political manipulation of ethnicity
The research question of this thesis (Chapter 1) was about why, how and on what
ethno-cultural and other basis the Tigraian nationalist movement emerged and prevailed,
how it successfully mobilized a critical mass of people behind it, and what the role of the
political elite vis-à-vis the masses was during and after the struggle. We highlighted the
role played by ethnicity but in a peculiar combination with revolutionary socialist
ideology that yielded both contradictions and elements of a strong though authoritarian
power ideology.
It was hypothesized in a general sense that in an underdeveloped multi-ethnic
society such as Ethiopia, where civil and political rights were traditionally not
institutionalized, political-economic ‘resource competition’ was a regular feature, and
collective claims are not recognized or adequately handled by the state administration,
the tendency for ethnic resistance/conflicts to emerge is high. With power concentrated in
the centre and in the hands of a privileged class, and basic resources being scarce and
conflict-generating, the political elite of a dominant ethnic or regional group in its quest
for power tends to manipulate ethnic antagonisms to remain in power, which in turn leads
to forms of countervailing ethnic resistance.
The case study of the TPLF and its emergence and experience in government has
borne out this hypothesis, and our account has also show that the same mechanism may
continue to operate under the new political regime based on the very notion of ethnic-
based governance, showing deficiencies in the allocation of equity and rights.
384In this thesis, the study of the rise and consolidation of an ethno-nationalist
insurgent front turned government has no doubt shown that ethnic nationalism, is a
forceful mobilizing ideology. In general it will remain so, also in comparable social
conditions - as long as political repression, economic marginalization and social
injustices are prevalent in a multi-ethnic and diverse society dominated by a political
force that openly or tacitly claims to represent a certain ethnic group. Ethno-nationalism
is forceful because it can be enacted as the embodiment of the material and social
concerns of a given people. This situation makes ethnic mobilization inevitable and the
imminence of confrontation real. On the basis of either primordial or instrumentalist
views of ethnicity, the self-appointed political elite of an ethnic collectivity or group can
draw this collectivity to become a force that can be mobilized for the realization of
political, economic or military aims, as illustrated here with the TPLF. It can unseat an
incumbent regime and achieve real or perceived advantages. We have seen this trajectory
unequivocally in the case of the TPLF. But since the phenomena and agenda of ethnic
nationalism are fluid, they can be easily manipulated by the elite in arbitrary and dubious
ways. The political consequences for the people in whose name the struggles were fought
can be a deception certainly when an institutionalized democracy is not realized that
negotiates identities, rights and equitable economic development. In Ethiopia the future is
still determined by the political elite which set the course of the ethnicized struggle.
Ernest Gellner (1964: 169) has argued that nationalism ‘invents nations where they do
not exist’, and over four decades after, TPLF/EPRDF’s ethno-nationalist banner has
paved the way for the emergence of ‘ethnic nations’ across the country and accentuated
there ‘rightful’ differences. This had created a conundrum of choices and political
dilemmas for the multi-ethnic society of Ethiopia. As much as the dominant elite of the
TPLF/EPRDF utilized ethnicity to come this far and defend the present power structure,
the marginalized elites may use similar tool to resist domination, fomenting ethnic
conflicts in which civil liberties and human rights, the essential elements of building civil
society, will be the casualties. Ethnic mobilization can only play a positive role only if it
385is based on establishing and institutionalizing civil liberties and human rights upon which
diversities are accommodated and differences are mediated democratically.
This thesis has thus demonstrated that however real and justified ethnic grievances
may be, and however understandable mobilization on an ethnic or ethno-regional basis
can be, the consequent and often organized politicization – and thereby rigidification - of
ethnic identity on a mass basis carries highly problematic aspects for a national political
order. The ‘ethnic model’, especially when coupled to an authoritarian political system of
governance, provides doubtful solutions to the issue of multi-ethnic identities and ethno-
regional disparity of a country, and diverts institutional democratic options. This
underlines the assumption of this thesis that ethnicity – by nature fluid and manipulable -
is best handled with care, lest it takes on a life of its own and becomes the prime conflict-
generating force in the social, political-economic and not the least psychological sense.

previous regimes and its demise marks the end of an era of subjugation and
oppression thus starting a new chapter in Ethiopian history in which freedom,

principles of political, economic and social life and thereby contributing to the
welfare of the Ethiopian Peoples and rescuing them from centuries of subjugation
and backwardness;
WHEREAS peace and stability, as essential conditions of development, require
the end of all hostilities, the healing of wounds caused by conflicts and the
establishment and maintenance of good neighbourliness and co-operation;
WHEREAS for the fulfilment of the aforementioned conditions and for the reign
of a just peace, the proclamation of a democratic order is a categorical imperative,
and;
WHEREAS to this end, all institutions of repression installed by the previous
regimes shall be dismantled a regional prejudices redressed and the rights and
interest of the deprived citizens safeguarded by a democratic government elected
by and accountable to the people;
WHEREAS from the Peace Loving and Democratic forces present in the
Ethiopian society and having Varied Views, having met in a Conference convened

Brief Profiles of the Founders and Leaders of the TPLF124
Gessesew Ayele (Sihul) See Chapter 3, par. ‘The role of Sihul’ (p. 71) for a whole
section devoted to his profile.
Zeru Gesesse (Agazi) was born in Wukro, Kilte-Awlaelo. He was raised by his
widowed mother who became a prison warder after her husband’s death. Agazi
was a second-year law-school student at Haile Silassie 1st University (H.S.I.U.) in
Addis Ababa when he joined the Front. Before going to university, he lived in
Asmara, Eritrea, with his aunt where he completed high school. He was influenced
at a young age by the rebel Eritrean movements and at the university in Addis
Ababa he was active in mobilizing Tigraians to fight for their right to self-
determination. A year after the TPLF’s struggle started, he was killed in the small
town of Wukro-Marai by Dergue militias while on a mission.
Fantahun Zeratsion (Ghiday) was born to Eritrean parents and raised in Aksum
and Shire-Enda Selassie, Tigrai. His father was, by Tigraian standards, a
reasonably successful businessman who owned a hotel. After completing high
school in Adwa and Meqele, Giday joined the Engineering Collage at H.S.I.U.,
where he was an activist in the Ethiopian Students’ Movement. He was committed
to the struggle of the TPLF and even ‘borrowed’ his father’s rifle and took it to the
bush thereby increasing the number of TPLF rifles at the start of activities to four.
He served as the vice chairman of the TPLF from 1978 to 1985. During the
formation of the MLLT, he was engaged in fierce debate with MLLT ideologue
Meles Zenawi on the role of the rural bourgeoisie and the nature of the revolution.
He was forced to resign from the organization and has lived in exile ever since.
Mulugeta Hagos (Asfaha) was born in Shire-Enda Selassie. His father was an
employee of the Ethiopian Telecommunications Authority in Enda-Selassie. He
went to high school in Meqele and was a fourth-year mathematics student in the
Faculty of Education at H.S.I.U. when he became involved in the TPLF. He was
active in the Tigraian underground movements and, although not in very good
health, worked hard in the early years of the struggle. He was not elected to the
First Fighters’ Congress but continued in the Front’s foreign office, where he
prepared important TPLF declarations and memorandums. Because he was critical
124 The reader will hopefully forgive the author (as an ex-TPLF member) his sometimes
somewhat personal reflections and remarks on some of these former colleagues and fellow
combatants.
412of the establishment of the MLLT, he was harassed by the Meles faction and was
forced to resign from the organization in 1988. He is still living in exile.
Ambaye Mesfin (Seyoum) was born in Adigrat where some of his family were
well-to-do businessmen and others belonged to a section of the traditional ‘feudal
class’ in Agame. He graduated from the Polytechnic Institute of Bahir Dar and
later joined the Engineering College at H.S.I.U. He was initially a ‘narrow
nationalist’ (i.e., pleading for the independence of Tigrai) and subsequently joined
Sibhat’s group to write the 1976 TPLF Manifesto, which clamoured for the
secession of Tigrai. Since the start of the struggle, he has worked in the
organization’s foreign office and later became Ethiopia’s Foreign Minister.
Amaha Tsehaye (Abaye) was born in Aksum and finished his high-school studies
in Meqele. He was a second-year language student in the Faculty of Arts at
H.S.I.U. when he was elected as an English editor for the university students’
journal entitled ‘Struggle’. He was also an activist in the Tigraian movement for
self-determination. He was the head of the TPLF’s political bureau from 1976
onwards but was always well known for ‘blowing with the wind’. He was Meles
Zenawi’s political mentor until he was fired from this position. However, he still
works with him in Addis Ababa.
Alemseged Mengesha (Hailu) was born in Abi-Adi, Tembien. He went to high
school in Meqele and was a second-year student at the Arts Faculty at H.S.I.U.
when he joined the Front. In the field, he was always deviating from the collective
norms that governed the leadership at the time and so was not elected to the
Front’s leadership at the First Fighters’ Congress in 1976. A year later, he
abandoned the organization and since then has lived in the US.
Aregawi Berhe (Berihu) was born in Adwa and went to high-school there. His
father was a district judge. He does not have any family ties with either Sibhat or
Seyoum, as Tecola W. Hagos (1995: 7) erroneously claims.125 He joined the
Science Faculty at H.S.I.U., but after eighteen months changed to political science
at the Faculty of Arts and continued until the fourth year. Like any revolutionary
125 In his book (1995), Tecola unfortunately started out with the misguided premise of
characterizing the leaders of the TPLF as ‘sons of feudal lords’. To justify his assumption, every
leader, regardless of his class origins, had to be put in that basket. The theory of some
intellectuals like Tecola (1995: 12), and also the Dergue, which states that the TPLF was created
by sons of such Tigraian feudal warlords does not reflect reality. Although organizationally
ethno-nationalists, the fundamental consciousness of these TPLF leaders was shaped by the
ideology of class struggle, which was the dominant view during that era. However, since ethno-
nationalism is a fluid ideology, one could not deny the emergence of ‘narrow nationalism’ in the
later years of the struggle, as Meles and Sibhat rose to power.
413of the day, he was an activist in the students’ movement and later an organizer of
the Tigraian youth who fought for self-determination within the Ethiopian polity.
He served as the chairman of the TPLF from 1976 to 1979 and as head of the
military committee until he was ousted by the Sibhat-Meles faction in 1986. Since
1988 he has lived in exile.
________________
The following TPLF members were not among the founding members but were
leading figures in subsequent stages of the struggle.
Mehari Tekle (Mussie) was born in Asmara, Eritrea, to Tigraian parents. His
father was a quite successful businessman from Aksum. Mussie went to what was
then called the Haile Selassie 1st High School in Asmara, and later joined the
Building College at Haile Sellassie I University in Addis Ababa, where he
continued until the fourth year. While there he was recruited by the EPLF and
joined the Front in 1973, but his heart was set on the Tigraian struggle. When
news of Tigraians initiating a struggle reached him, he immediately contacted the
founders of the TPLF and, with the consent of the EPLF leadership, joined them
from the start of their struggle. Because of his reliable track record and vital
experience, he was elected as a member of the leadership. He was the Front’s
military commander when he died, fighting the EDU, in the Battle of
Chiameskebet on 23 September 1977.
Woldesilassie Nega (Sibhat). A TPLF CC member since 1976 was born in a
village called Adi-Abune near Adwa where his father was a fitawrari who owned
substantial farmlands. Sibhat claims to be a descendant of a legendary warrior
known locally as Wa’ero, who is said to have owned large tracts of land in the
district of Adwa. In this sense he was filled with ‘feudal sentiments’, which earned
him the nickname ‘feudal intriguer’. He finished high-school in Meqele and
studied agricultural economics at H.S.I.U. He joined the Front at Dedebit and was
an ordinary member until he was elected to the leadership at the Fighters’
Congress in 1976. He showed to be strongly ethno-nationalist, and organized like-
minded individuals around himself and considers any ‘Amhara’ as his enemy. His
relations with the other people in the Front are reputed to be clannish and nobody
knows what tangible political or military contribution he had in the struggle; but,
as Tecola W. Hagos (1995: 8) rightly put it, indeed he ‘is the ‘Exchequer’ of the
TPLF’.
414Meles (original name Legesse) Zenawi was born in 1955 to a Tigraian father and
an Eritrean mother in Adwa, Tigrai, where his father had 20-30 heads of cattle
near the River Mereb. He went to the General Wingate Highschool in Addis
Ababa, where he had close contact with various British teachers. He was a second-
year pre-med student at H.S.I.U when he was recruited as a potential fighter in the
TPLF. In Asmara in 1975, Meles slipped away from the first group that was bound
for the EPLF base area for military training, but later joined the Front in Tigrai.
Although he was assigned to the TPLF’s political bureau as a subsidiary to Abbay
Tsehaye, his political position at the time was never stable or consistent. During
the second year of the struggle, Meles Zenawi together with Atsbaha Dagnew
(Shewit), Raswork Kesela (Atakelti), Sahle Abraha (Seye), Tikue Woldu
(Awaalom) were appointed by the CC to serve as deputy CC members. Meles
Zenawi eventually became the MLLT/TPLF leader. Ideologically, he was very
flexible, e.g., shifting from ethnic nationalism to socialist internationalism (in the
MLLT) or from Maoist socialism to state-led capitalism (after 1991).

418Samenvatting
Een Politieke Geschiedenis van het Tigray People’s Liberation Front (1975-1991): Opstand,
Ideologie en Mobilisatie in Ethiopië
Deze studie wil een bijdrage leveren tot de historische beschrijving en politieke
verklaring van de relatie tussen sociaal-politieke ongelijkheid, etno-regionale
identiteiten en collectieve mobilisatie in Afrika, met name Ethiopië. De case-study
is de opkomst en ontwikkeling van een etno-nationalistische beweging in Noord-
Ethiopië. Deze beweging, de Tigray Peoples’ Liberation Front (TLPF), kwam op in
1975 en nam na 17 jaar van gewapende strijd in 1991 de staatsmacht over. De
auteur geeft een retrospectieve analyse van de politieke en militaire geschiedenis
van deze beweging, die in 2008 nog steeds de de facto regerende partij is in Ethiopië
onder de naam Ethiopian Peoples’ Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). In
vergelijkend opzicht was de uitdaging van de studie om de patronen van mobilisatie,
organisatie en ideologie te verklaren, de relevantie van de factor van etniciteit te
analyseren en deze succesvolle beweging op kernpunten te vergelijken met andere
Afrikaanse bewegingen.
De centrale onderzoeksvraag was waarom, hoe en op welke basis een
nationalistische beweging in Tigrai opkwam (leidend tot het TPLF), op welke wijze
deze succes had in de mobilisatie van de jeugd en later de bevolking het algemeen,
en hoe elite-politiek hiertoe bijdroeg en de beweging ideologisch en politiek-militair
gestalte gaf via een vergaand proces van - van bovenaf geleide – sociale verandering
en politieke hervorming op locaal niveau, leidend tot een overwinning op de legers
van de Ethiopische centrale regering. Een fundamentele discussie van de rol van
etniciteit en etnische identiteit als verschijnsel in Ethiopië, en de rol die dit element
werd toebedeeld door de wisselende elite van het TPLF, is hierbij belangrijk. De
auteur poneert dat de bijzondere combinatie van etno-regionale en Ethiopian style
419‘revolutionair-socialistische’ ideologie belangrijk was en leidde tot sterke en
autoritaire machtsidelogie die binnen en buiten het TPLF werd afgedwongen.
Als algemene hypothese werd gesteld dat in een onderontwikkelde, sterk
multi-etnische samenleving zoals Ethiopië, waar civiele en politieke rechten van de
bevolking traditioneel niet waren geïnstitutionaliseerd, politiek-economische
competitie om hulpbronnen van materiële (staatsfondsen, inversteringen, banen,
bestuursposities) en sociaal-culturele aard (macht, prestige, toegang tot eliteposities)
schaars zijn en leiden tot collectieve claimpolitiek op basis van onderliggende
identiteiten op grond van regio, etno-linguïstische groep en ‘etnische’ identiteit.
Indien deze claims door de staatsadministratie niet worden erkend of er niet aan
wordt tegemoet gekomen, groeit de kans op militant verzet en conflict. Dit was in
Ethiopië het geval. Met macht en economische distributie geconcentreerd in het
centrum en ingebed in een zero-sum game beheerst door een historisch gegroeide
elite uit een bepaalde etno-regio werd de tendens tot monopolisering van de
hulpbronnen in etnische of etnoregionale termen vertaald, hetgeen een sociaal-
psychologische dimensie toevoegde aan de bestaande sociaal-economische
rivaliteiten. Gezien de Ethiopische traditie van sociaal ‘banditisme’ en (gewapend)
verzet tegen waargenomen onrecht en onderdrukking groeide aldus het
conflictpotentieel.
Om in het kort de opzet van de studie weer te geven: zij begint met een schets
van de sociale, historische en politieke omstandigheden waarin het TPLF opkwam,
hoe men besloot tot gewapende strijd en hoe leden werden gerecruteerd. Eveneens
werd de achtergrond van de opkomende conflicten tussen concurrerende
revolutionaire en etno-nationalistische ‘bevrijdingsbewegingen’ in de woelige tijden
na de Ethiopische revolutie van 1974 besproken – onderling alsook met het militaire
regime (de Derg) dat in februari 1974 de macht had overgenomen van keizer Haile
Selassie I. Een kernpunt in de revolutionaire omwentelingen van die tijd leek te zijn
– naast sociale of ‘klassenstrijd’ tegen de feodaal genoemde keizerlijke orde - de
ideologische discussie rond het begrip ‘nationale zelfbeschikking’, dat door diverse
420bewegingen en in verschillende stadia van de strijd anders werd ingevuld, ook in die
van het TPLF. Het tweede hoofdstuk van de dissertatie bevat theoretische reflecties
over etniciteit, politiek en collectieve mobilisatie en de relevantie ervan in Afrika in
het algemeen en Ethiopië in het bijzonder, met verwijzing naar de theorieën van o.a.
Tilly, Esman, Gur, Skocpol en Colburn. Voorts gaat de studie in op de cruciale rol
van de eerste groep van jonge leiders, die opmerkelijk genoeg erin slaagden te
overleven op het Tigraise platteland en de beweging van de grond te krijgen.
Achtergrond, samenstelling en strategie van de elite in een collectieve beweging
wordt als cruciaal gezien. Daarna wordt besproken de aard van de feitelijke relaties
van het TPLF met de diverse strijdende partijen binnen Ethiopië, met name de
oorlog tegen de centrale staat en de spanningen met de Eritrese bevrijdingsbeweging
het Eritrean People’s Liberation Front (EPLF) in Eritrea, Hierbij wordt uitvoerig
aandacht besteed aan de militaire en politieke ontwikkelingen. Daarna volgt een
analyse van de wijze waarop een deel van de leidende ‘revolutionaire elite’ van het
TPLF via een ‘voorhoedepartij’ (als vanguard of the revolution) in het midden van
de jaren 1980 de doeleinden en strategie van de beweging herdefineerde. Dit
gebeurde via de Marxist-Leninist League of Tigrai (MLLT), die begon als een
geheime kern binnen het TPLF en het belangrijkste instrument werd om de
beweging over te nemen en een nieuwe identiteit te geven. Tenslotte wordt
beschreven hoe het TPLF geleidelijk via goed georganiseerde politieke en militaire
campagnes op het slagveld de overhand kreeg en uiteindelijk de staatsmacht
veroverde in 1991. Het slothoofdstuk maakt een vergelijkende analyse van het
TPLF met andere Afrikaans sociale en/of nationalistische verzetsbewegingen – allen
typische producten van de jaren 1960-70 in hun links-revolutionaire ideologie en
collectieve organisatie en die in de huidige tijd nauwelijks meer voorkomen - en
werkt toe naar een aantal slotopmerkingen over staat, etniciteit, etno-nationale
revolte, sociale mobilisatie en voorwaarden tot succes van een gewapende strijd om
de macht. Dit proefschrift is gebaseerd op de studie van archiefmateriaal en
secundaire literatuur, participerende observatie van de auteur (als deelnemer in het
421TPLF vanaf het eerste uur tot ca. 1986), en gepubliceerde en ongepubliceerde
memoires alsmede op interviews met sleutelinformanten die tot de beweging
behoorden.
De achtergrondshoofdstukken van de studie stellen dat in de jaren 1960 de
sociale en politieke condities in de noordelijke regio Tigrai, waar de TPLF-revolte
begon, alsmede in de rest van Ethiopië, overwegend werden gekenmerkt door
economische stagnatie, massale armoede, afbrokkelende legitimiteit van de
imperiale orde en politieke repressie. Autocratisch bestuur en persistente ethno-
regionale en ethno-linguistische ongelijkheid kweekten grote onvrede. Echter, de
interpretatie van, en reacties op, deze condities wisselden – er waren sociaal-
revolutionaire, Marxistische verzetsgroepen, met name onder de studenten in Addis
Ababa, alsook sterk door etnische ideologie getekende reacties, die de ‘nationale
kwestie’ als kernprobleem zagen boven de sociale ongelijkheid, politieke repressie
en hegemonisme, die in het hele land voelbaar waren.
De regio Tigrai, kende, zoals de meeste meer perifere delen van Ethiopië,
grote armoede en gebrek aan investeringen en ontwikkeling. Gekoppeld aan de
perceptie van vergane historische glorie (Tigrai was één van de kerngebieden van de
historische Ethiopische staat) en relatieve deprivatie leidde dit tot groeiende onvrede
over het slinkend nationaal prestige en de stagnatie van elitevorming en
doorstroming naar de nationale machtscentra. Na de bevrijding van Ethiopië in 1941
van de Fascistisch-Italiaanse bezetting en in het licht van de hoge verwachtingen
van de naoorlogse restauratie van de onafhankelijke staat onder keizer Haile
Selassie ontstond in 1942-43 een eerste rebellie in oost- en zuid-Tigrai onder de
naam ‘Woyyane’. Dit was een precedent in imperiaal Ethiopië dat het (etno-
)regionale zelfbewustzijn van de regio stimuleerde en een soort voorbeeld of
referentiepunt werd voor jongere generaties. De grondleggers van het TPLF deelden
dit en speelden erop in bij de formulering van hun missie tot opstand en sociale
omwenteling, rond de tijd van de ‘revolutionaire’ machtsgreep in 1974 die werd
uitgevoerd door Ethiopische legerofficieren.
422Terwijl deze ‘voorlopige militaire regering’, de Derg, destijds nog naar een
mobiliserende ideologie zocht en al spoedig uitkwam bij Marxistisch socialisme,
poogden de TPLF-stichters Marxistische ideeën - afkomstig uit de invloedrijke
Ethiopische studentenbeweging van de jaren 1960-70 - te combineren met ideeën
over de etno-nationale strijd om ‘zelfbeschikking’, een begrip dat in meer
Stalinistische (en niet democratische) zin werd geïnterpreteerd. Deze ideologische
ambivalentie bleef bestaan binnen het TPLF in de daaropvolgende jaren en is van
belang omdat het TPLF nog aan de macht is en de huidige politieke dynamiek in
Ethiopië voor een zeer belangrijk deel wordt bepaald door deze ideologische
stellingnames en gerelateerde beheersingstactieken.
Deze twee sporen, die vanaf het begin van de beweging aanwezig waren,
leidden binnen de ontwikkeling van het TPLF tot spanningen die ondanks de
gestage groei van de beweging, op bepaalde momenten van crisis naar voren
kwamen, maar het beroep op etno-nationale elementen was wel een succesvolle
mobilisatiestrategie in de regio Tigrai. De eerste stroming (die van de oprichters)
zag de revolte van de TPLF vooral als een voorhoede en deel van de nationale (pan-
Ethiopische) strijd om revolutionaire sociale verandering en bevrijding van de
autocratie, de tweede was meer gericht op een etno-regionale agenda die op
sommige momenten leidde tot exclusivisme en streven naar etno-regionale
zelfbeschikking en zelfs ‘afscheiding’ (bv. in een ‘TPLF Manifest’ van 1976, dat
sprak van een onafhankelijke Republiek Tigrai. Dit werd niet de
meerderheidspositie in de beweging). Deze stroming gaf een specifieke, meer rigide
interpretatie van de fluïditeit van etniciteit die Ethiopië, inclusief die van de regio
Tigrai, historisch had gekenmerkt. Hierbij werden etnische en taalkundig kenmerken
als allesbepalend gezien. Deze strakke interpretatie van een verschijnsel - en een
identiteit - die ook lokaal als relatief flexibel en ook door andere elementen bepaald
werden gezien, was niet de visie van de gewone bevolking van Tigrai maar wel van
veel studenten, onderwijzers, en opkomende jonge stedelijke elitegroepen die het
TPLF steunden. Deze tweede stroming binnen het TPLF zette echter in op deze
423etno-regionale kaart om het vijandbeeld van de centrale regering te vergroten en het
mobilisatievermogen van de beweging te versterken (Het element van etnische
‘exclusiviteit’ in politieke zin zou later terugkomen in de Ethiopische grondwet van
1994, die burgerschap ook definieërde in termen van etnisch toebehoren).
De richtingenstrijd leidde binnen het TPLF tot interne rivaliteit en
zuiveringen, waarbij de eerste stroming (waaronder de meeste oprichters van de
beweging) uit het leiderschap werd verwijderd. De historische ironie wil dat de
nieuwe leiderschap, i.e. de ‘parochiale’vleugel, in 1990, vlak voor de
machtsopvername in Addis Ababa in 1991, terugkeerde tot het ‘pan-Ethiopische’
perspectief, en de beweging EPRDF (zie boven) vormde. Deze, ofschoon strak
geleid door het TPLF als leidende kern, stelde te streven naar een nationale formule
van etno-federale verbondenheid van de diverse ‘etnische groepen’ van het land.
Deze ontwikkeling bevestigt de these van deze studie dat het beroep op
etniciteit diende als mobilisatie-ideologie binnen en buiten de beweging
(respectievelijk om een greep naar de macht te doen en om de problemen van het
land aan te scherpen en vooral als ‘etnisch’ voor te stellen, daarmee ruimte
creeërend voor de plaats van de eigen regio binnen het bredere geheel). Hiermee
wordt andermaal aangetoond dat (een beroep op) etniciteit, als cultureel en
veralgemeend ‘familiegevoel’, zich relatief gemakkelijk laat gebruiken door elites.
Op grond van de politieke en militaire ontwikkeling van de strijd van het TPLF is
het de overtuiging van de auteur dat deze wending naar een etno-regionale agenda
midden jaren 1980 leidde tot een vertraging van alliantievorming van het TPLF met
andere verzetsbewegingen in Ethiopië en tot een langere militaire strijd tegen de
centrale Derg regering. De belangen van de Tigraise bevolking (het was een tijd van
grote voedseltekorten) waren daarbij voor het nieuwe leiderschap van secundair
belang.
Ondertussen werd de op mobilisering gerichte ideologisch-politieke
boodschap aan de Tigrai-bevolking steeds meer die van het etno-nationalisme. In
historische zin poneerde dit etno-nationalisme in de Ethiopische situatie een
424dilemma: was het een mobilisatiemechanisme van algemene geldigheid in tijden van
politieke crisis of was het vooral een ‘opportunistische’ strategie of agenda om in
een gemarginaliseerde regio mensen te mobiliseren die geen andere dominante
collectieve identiteit - zoals klasse, natie, beroep, religie, etc. hadden? Kon het een
basis zijn voor nationale politieke agenda? De regio Tigrai was altijd een deel van
het historisch, staatsvormende Ethiopië sinds het Aksum-rijk (2e eeuw vóór tot 9e
eeuw na Chr.) en de locale bevolking zag zich als zodanig. De sinds eind 19e eeuw
gegroeide politieke dominantie van de Shewa-Amhara groep op nationaal niveau
leidde tot onvrede en verzet in Tigrai, maar het was niet zeker of een model van
vervanging van de ene etno-regionale elite (‘Amhara’) door de ander (Tigrai) de
oplossing zou zijn voor een evenwichtiger nationale politiek in Ethiopië.
Gedurende de gewapende strijd van het TPLF bleven ideologische vragen
over de aard van de sociaal-politieke problemen van het land en de richting van de
strijd en de periode ná de verwachte overwinning de beweging bezig houden.
Doctrinaire verschillen werden boven al genoemd. Verder hield men zich bezig met
de vraag of de ‘onderdrukking van Tigrai’ de meest extreme vorm van ‘etnische’,
taalkundige en culturele onderdrukking in Ethiopië was. Er was geen economische
dimensie: het ging de centrale regering niet om hulpbronnen van Tigrai, want die
waren er niet of nauwelijks. Men had echter weinig kennis of bewustzijn van de
situatie in andere delen van het land, waar de etno-regionale ongelijkheid en
onderdrukking evenzeer werd gevoeld door andere etnisch/taalkundige groepen. De
leiders van het TPLF negeerden ook de impact van de opstanden in Bale (1963-70),
Gojjam (1968-69) en Eritrea (sinds 1962), die met harde militaire middelen werden
aangepakt. Exclusieve claims over de onderdrukking van Tigrai, zoals die bv.
werden gevonden in het TPLF Manifest van 1976, klonken daarom sterk
overdreven, maar dit diende om de kwestie-Tigrai te formuleren in termen van
‘nationale onderdrukking’ (van volk door volk) en aldus politiek en militair te
mobiliseren. Er bleef zelfs in Tigrai zelf een verschil bestaan tussen de agenda van
zelfbeschikking en de historische en door sociale structuur en religieuze cutuur
425ondersteunde pan-Ethiopische sentimenten van de gewone bevolking. Binnen de
boerensamenleving van Tigrai kreeg het TPLF-programma echter steun deels
vanwege de hoop van de boeren op een sociaal-economische transformatie - die
werd begonnen door het TPLF in de bevrijde gebieden - en op bevrijding van de
oppressie door de centrale staat, en deels vanwege de strikte sociale en politieke
controle en dwangmiddelen die het TPLF hanteerde, in het licht van haar ideologie
als voorhoedepartij naar Leninistisch model. Uiteindelijk leidde de etno-regionale
agenda van het TPLF tot de idee van ‘etnische zelfbeschikking tot en met
afscheiding’, een clausule die in de grondwet van 1994 (art. 39) werd opgenomen en
werd geëxporteerd naar andere regio’s in Ethiopië, waar zgn. PDO’s (People’s
Democratic Organisations) werden opgericht als etnische extensies van het
regerende TPLF in de diverse ‘etnische groepen’. Op grond van de specifieke aard
van de Ethiopische multi-etnische samenleving, de traditie van staatsvorming en
etnische interactiepatronen is het zeer de vraag of in theoretisch, juridisch en
praktisch opzicht zo’n model van ‘institutionalisering’ van etniciteit, erfenis van de
TPLF ideologie en gehandhaafd vanwege het succes ervan in de volksmobilisatie en
de gewapende strijd in Tigrai - ooit duurzaam kan werken in het land. Het huidige
Ethiopische politieke systeem draagt hoe dan ook nog sterk het stempel van de
ideologie van het TPLF zoals die na 1985 gestalte kreeg – met name in de vorm van
‘revolutionaire democratie’ (sinds 1990) - maar die niet alle sociale, economische en
politieke uitdagingen van het land heeft opgelost. De problemen die al bestonden
gedurende de 17 jaar gewapende oppositie en interne conflicten binnen het
leiderschap – met name over de relatie tussen erkenning van etnische identiteiten en
die van democratische grondwaarden en burgerlijke vrijheden op nationale i.p.v.
etnische basis - blijven een punt van controverse in de Ethiopische politiek.
