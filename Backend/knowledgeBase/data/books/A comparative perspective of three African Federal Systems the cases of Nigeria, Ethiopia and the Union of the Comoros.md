Abstract
Federalism is one of the most common solutions are offered to solve the problems in
divided societies. Only a few countries have federal experiences conducted in Africa. Among
them, Nigeria is the only one maintained in its Constitution federalism since its independence.
These institutional arrangements are slowly extended to other countries from the mid 90s.
Ethiopia and the Union of the Comoros. Ethiopia and the Union of Comoros introduced
federalism in their constitutions as a way to end secessionist trends that had led these countries
to situations of state collapse. Nigeria and Ethiopia are deeply divided societies religiously and
ethnically. However, Comoros is a homogeneous society in ethnic and religious terms, but
strongly divided for reasons of being an archipelagic State. In all three cases offer different
institutional arrangements, ranging from the creation of ethnically homogeneous member states,
as in Nigeria, to the rotation between the different member states of the presidency, as in
Comoros, or opening the institutional channels for possible independence of any of the member
states, such as Ethiopia. Nevertheless, none of these three African federal experiences seems to
solve successfully all the problems of their divided societies on its configuration as nation states,
not seem to put an end to the centrifugal tendencies of certain parts of their territories. Either
way, his remarkable institutional differences, these countries seem to have channeled, with
varying success, some of the problems that prevented them from living without the constant
threat of rupture of the State.
Key-words: Federalism, ethnic accommodation, political decentralization

Introduction
Federal Experiences in Africa or how trying to accomodate diversity in Africa Since
Independence.
Federalism has not had too much success in the African constitutionalism, despite being
proposed at various times as a possible solution to accommodating African cultural, ethnic and
religious diversity. In fact, some of the countries that had in the beginning, at the time of
emancipation, a federal constitution, as was the case of Cameroon, quickly opted for a
centralized unitary state formula, despite the opposition of the former territory that had formed
part of the British mandate after the first world war, that decided to join with the Francophone
mandate of the Cameroon to form a new African country, but under a federalism political system
(Emmanuel Anyefru, 2010, and Susan Dicklitch, 2011). Federalism also was tested in any of the
peace agreements of the old pre-partition Sudan before 2011, which resulted in two new federal
African countries: Sudan and South Sudan. Federal system have persisted in Nigeria, virtually
since independence, in Ethiopia, since the 90s as a solution of decades of civil wars, and in the
1856 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
Union of the Comoros, since the beginning of the 21 century (2001). But we should note that,
despite their constitutional proclamation, the degree of political decentralization of the African
federal states in most of these countries is scarce. Michel Burgess observed that "Federalism in
Africa does not have a positive image. Its record of success is patchy while its failures seem
manifest" (M. Burguess, 2012: 3). For this author, there are currently only 3 countries with a
federal political system among the 54 African countries: Nigeria, Ethiopia and South Africa1. I
think we must differentiate between formal or constitutional federalism, as in a lot of African and
Latin American countries, and true nationalism, that is, federalism in the constitution and in
practice, as in the United States. Despite such little success in the African continent, federal
solutions are still present in the political and academic discourse as well as in the
recommendations of various international organizations as a solution to resolve the problem of
how to accommodate ethnic, cultural and religious diversity in African countries. Following
Burgess, we establish four basic conceptual categories that have left their mark on the African
continent:
A) Territorial Unions formed by political and administrative convenience of the colonial
administrations. In this category the federal idea consists in joining various local colonial
authorities coordinated or directed from a center or capital, as it is the case of the French Western
Africa (AOF) and French Equatorial Africa (AEF), who rallied under the leadership of a
Governor-General, who ruled these territorial administrative unions from Dakar and Brazzaville.
1 I am not sure South Africa is a Federal political or constitutional system. If we read the South
African constitution it doesn't define the country as a federal state. I think South Africa is one of
the most decentralized African countries, but its provinces seems like the Spanish Autonomous
Communities more than of federated states members. Nigeria and Ethiopia constitutions define
their respective countries as a Federal Republics, their official names are Federal Republics,
although they aren't in fact as decentralized as South Africa.
1857 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
The remaining colonies in these two territorial administrative unions were governed by a
Lieutenant-governors. In the Anglophone colonial Africa also lived experiences of this kind in
the regional division of Nigeria into three regions, held in 1914, which would be the foundation
of the first Federal Republic of Nigeria; or, later, the ephemeral creation of the Central African
Federation (CAF), which lasted from 1953-1963, that was born as a possible federative formula
of the colonies of the two Rhodesia (now Zambia and Zimbabwe) and Nyasa (now Malawi), and
lasted until the independence of two of these countries (Zambia and Malawi) in 1963.
B) The federations or unions to maintain ties with the colonial power. Such is the case in the
British Empire of the Commonwealth attempt to create an East Africa federation, consisting of
Uganda, Kenya and Tanganyika; and especially the French Union, during the Fourth Republic,
and the French Community, in the early years of the V French Republic.
C) Another formula was and is the commercial unions, based on economic and trade issues.
Burgess gives us the example of the East Africa Common Services Organization (EACSO),
which lasted until 1977, but it languished since its inception.
D) The state and (multi)national building process in Africa, as are the three cases to which we
will refer below.
The independence era began with several federal experiments those did not end well, they were
the "unhappy marriages" in Paul Nugent's words (2004: 435). The unions between the British
Southern Cameroons and the French Cameroon mandates, the British and Italian territories in
1858 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
Somalia, or the union of the British mandate of Tanganyika and the colony of Zanzibar, called
into question the border tracings of the colonial era, as well as the union of Eritrea to Ethiopia,
but in most cases, the territorial unions have lived with growing frustration those, in the case of
Somalia and Eritrea, ended in civil wars or armed insurrections in search of secessionism. In
these cases, the imprint of the colonial culture and the process of colonization seems to be
stronger than belonging to the same ethnic and religious group, as in Somalia. The case of
Tanzania is a successful case because the broad powers that the Tanzanian Constitution grants to
Zanzibar. After independence, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Zaire, Cameroon, Ethiopia, on its
relationship with Eritrea, the Mali Federation, that was the union of Senegal and French Sudan,
now Mali, and Tanzania, to reach the union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar, formed federal states.
We note that with federalism some African countries tried to establish relations between former
different colonies. Some of which reached success in its attempts for building a new country, as
is the case of Tanzania and Cameroon, but in other cases, as the Mali Federation, it was a failure.
Dean E. McHenry, Jr. (1997) identifies ten cases of African countries that opted into their first
Constitutions by federal structures: Cameroon, between 1962-1972, the present Democratic
Republic of Congo (Zaire and Belgian former Congo), between 1960 and 1965, Ethiopia,
between 1952 and 1962, Kenya, between 1963 and 1965, Senegal and French Sudan (Mali),
from July to August 1960, Sudan, from 1972-1983, Tanzania, and Uganda, between 1962 and
1966. As it can be seen, the federal experiences were few and temporary short range, but some of
them, with small or large setbacks, have survived, such is the case of Nigeria, since 1960,
Ethiopia, since 1991, South Africa, since 1994, and the Union of the Comoros, since 2001. These
countries, along with Tanzania, product, as I said before, of the special relationship between the
mainland, the former colony of Tanganyika, and the island of Zanzibar. But I estimate that this
1859 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
case is moot, despite its degree of administrative and political decentralization, as well as the
case of Sudan and South Sudan, which McHenry, Jr., failed to include in his article because he
wrote it twelve years before the partition of Sudan. As it is well known, as a result of the peace
agreements, the new formally federal states of Sudan and South Sudan are composed of 25 and
10 states respectively. Also in recent years has joined the club of Africa countries which has
chosen this federal formula for accommodating diversity to solve conflicts between different
ethnic or religious groups or parts of the state territory, the Union of the Comoros, and has opted
for other forms of political and administrative decentralization, Kenya.
Three african case studies: Federalism in Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the Comoros.
The Federal Republic of Nigeria: 50 years in search of an Ethnic Federalism Formula.
The current Federal Constitution of Nigeria, approved in 1999, has had several
constitutional antecedents in his history. The most significant ones, during the colonial era, are
the 1951 and 1954 Constitutions, and, during the independent period, the Constitutions of 1963
and 1979. Nigerian Pan-Africanism was stronger in the south than in the Muslim north, where
the Hausa-Fulani emirates remained virtually unchanged in the administration of public affairs
during the British colonization (Alemseged Abbay, 2010). In 1947, it was established in Nigeria
a Legislative Council with very limited powers. These powers were regulated by the so-called
Richards Constitution. To the north was the first time they accepted to be represented in a
legislative assembly of the entire colony with the other two territories of the colony. Since then,
political parties developed strong electoral and political basis in each one of the three major
regions of Nigeria, although some of them tried to overcome regional boundaries and encompass
the entire territory of Nigeria. In Nigeria, unlike in other African countries, there was not an only
1860 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
political party or leader who lead the independence movement with the support of the majority of
the Nigerian population of the three regions. Moreover, with few exceptions, political parties
tended to have an ethnic or ethnic-regional basis. The Action Group (AG) was a Yoruba basis
political party, as it also was the Northern People's Congress (NPC) for the northern Hausa-
Fulani. The Yoruba representatives of Western Nigeria and the Ibo representatives of Eastern
Nigeria demanded an immediate independence, but not the northerners representatives. In 1953,
the NPC rejected a motion of the Yoruba AG for greater self-government. The northern
representatives came to advocate the separation of the north of the rest of the country and the
creation of a future independent country in Northern Nigeria.
The Constitutions of 1951 and 1954 laid the groundwork for future federal Nigeria.
Article 5 of the 1951 constitution stated that "Nigeria will be divided into three regions, which
are known respectively as the North Region, Western Region and Eastern Region". In these three
regions, which the Constitution allowed to subdivide into new geographic areas, which could call
provinces, or new administrative divisions. The southern regions of the English Cameroons, who
opted to joined Nigeria and not Cameroon, and the capital city of Lagos, which was called
Federal Territory in his article, joined those three traditional regions in the Constitution of 1954
as new regional territories of the colony of Nigeria. Along with the central political institutions
of the entire colony, the Constitutions of 1951 and 1954 created regional parliaments in each of
the new regional entities. To the North and West, because of their tradition, they picked a two
chamber parliament: an upper chamber, called the Council of Chiefs, and a lower one, called the
House of Assembly. For the Eastern region, with a majority of Ibo people more Christianized
and Westernized, only provided one lower chamber. The lower chambers were chaired by
members of the same chamber, not so the high chamber, that was presided by the Lieutenant-
1861 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
governor of each of the two North and West regions of Nigeria. The Constitution of 1954
regulated only a single federal legislative chamber, the House of Representatives, and an
executive with broad powers. Obafemi Awolowo wrote in 1947, as Paul Nugent reminds us, that
"Nigeria is not a Nation. It is a mere geographical expression" (cited by P. Nugent, 2004: 89). In
each region was established a different ruling party, but also the Nigerian plural reality brought
out another ethnic based parties those represented the interests of minority ethnic groups within
each region who are different than the hegemonic political party in each of the three regions.
These intra-regional political parties were supported by each one of the other three major parties
outside the region as a way to limit the power of each of those three parties in their respective
region (Wale Adebanwi and Ebenezer Obadare, 2010). Especially, to limit the power of the NPC
in the North, due to weight and extension of this region in the future Nigeria Federal Assembly.
The last parliamentary election in colonial Nigeria, held in 1959, were won, but not with
sufficient majority of the votes, by the NPC, who joined the leading Eastern region party, the
National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC), led by Azikiwe, to form the Nigerian
Executive. These two parties shared the Nigerian Presidency for Azikiwe of the NCNC, and the
post of Prime Minister for Abubakar Balewa Tafala of the northern NPC.
The first Constitution of independent Nigeria dating back to 1960. Its article 2 stated that
the "Federation of Nigeria consist of Regions and a federal territory". Collected article 3
regulated, as prescribed both colonial Constitutions, that the regions were three: North, West and
East. The Federal Territory was the federal capital, Lagos. In its article 5 noted that each region
would have a regional Constitution. As a member of the Commonwealth and its subsequent
conversion to Republic, Nigeria gained independence with her Majesty Queen of England as
Chief of State. Her representative in the Nigerian Federation and Commander in Chief of the
1862 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
Army was the General Governor. The form of government that was established following the
British Westminster model, was a parliamentary political system, that is, a Prime Minister,
member of the federal parliament and elected by it, a federal parliament consisted of two Houses
or chambers, the Senate, chamber of territorial representation, and the House of Representatives,
where it is represented the people of Nigeria as a whole. The Senate is made up of 12 Senators
from each region, who were elected by the legislatures of each regional entity, 4 Senators of the
Federal Territory (Lagos) and 4 selected by the Governor General on the advice of the federal
Prime Minister (article 37 ). The lower House was composed of 305 deputies. The Parliament
official language was English, which is consistent with the fact that Nigeria is speaking over 200
languages and dialects and none of the three major communities languages of the country
(Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba and Ibo) would allow to prevail over the other two languages. The
parliamentary office term was set at 5 years, which could be extended or dissolved in advance by
the Governor General. To dissolve it first needed the agreement of the Prime-Minister. The
executive power rested nominally in the Governor-General, as the Queen's representative, and in
the Prime-Minister. This one selected the members of the Council of Ministers. The Constitution
stated that in the regions should have a governor, a legislative chamber, an executive council,
and a high court. The Constitution didn't say how many chambers should compose the regional
parliaments or their names, as so it did the previous colonial Constitutions.
The first years of independent Nigeria, as it will subsequent to this day, are characterized
by political instability, because the regional conflict resolutions, and ethnic and religious
conflicts. In short, the problem was how could the country solve the accommodation of plurality
or diversity constitutional and politically. We can say that, in general, the North and their
representatives, either in the military or in politics, will give their support sometimes to Ibos and
1863 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
sometimes to Yorubas in order to maintain their power control over the Nigerian Government. In
1963 began to unravel the regional, ethnic, cultural and religious distribution which had founded
the new country in 1959. Its article 3 prescribed the existence of one more region (four regions
plus the Federal Territory of Lagos). The fourth region, the Midwest region, was the product of
the division of the Western Yoruba region to meet ethnic rivalries within that region. In Chapter
IV, the 1963 Constitution regulated the Federal President. The Federal President had to be
elected for members of the two Federal Chambers, those formed a Federal Electoral Assembly
composed of Deputies and Senators. The President was elected for 5 years term. Parliament was
covered with the same two chambers as in the 1960 Constitution. The executive branch is set up
as a dual executive, in which the Head of State was the President, and Prime-Minister was
elected by the House of Representatives from among its members. It constituted a Republic with
a parliamentary form of government Westminster style, and federal and regional institutions as
designed in the previous 1960 Constitution. In January 1966, came the first one of a series of
military coups that mark Nigerian political life to this day (P.O. Agbese, 1992, Toyin Falola and
others, 1994, and J.O. Ihonvbere, 1998). In this coup d'état were killed several of the various
regional leaders, as the northerners Bello and Balewa, or the Yoruba leader Akintola. The army
had already been involved in several regional conflicts, called by the regional governors or the
Federal President. This coup d'état has been interpreted as an Ibo coup. Major Nzeogwu, Ibo,
tried, literally, to got rid of politicians that had led the country to chaos. The army chief, Ironsi,
Ibo, survived the coup and did give up and surrender to the rebels. Ironsi became the new
President and initiated steps to end with federalism, because, in his opinion, federalism
exacerbated ethnic divisions. To do this, he began abolishing the regions, but, at the same time,
Ibo officers were promoted to higher positions of responsibility in the army, which broke with
1864 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
the army ethnic quotas system. The North began to rebel against the situation through massacres
of Ibo immigrants in that region. In July, Hausa soldiers mutinied and killed their Ibo officers.
One of their victims was President General Ironsi. The mutineers asked for maintain the
Northern Region or to segregated from the rest of the country. General Gowon, a northern, took
over the power, placing a Constitutional Conference for the month of September 1966. The Ibos,
those have a higher educational level, were more and better represented in the Nigerian army and
public administration, and were persecuted in the North, where thousands died at the hands of
the mob. The colonel, of Ibo origin, Ojukwu made the decision to segregate the Eastern region of
Nigeria, which led to the beginning of the bloody Biafra war, when Biafra took theoretical
independence as a new African country, in 1967 (H. Ekwe-Ekwe, 1991). To attract minority
ethnic groups in Biafra, General Gowon divided the 4 regions into 12 new regions. The war
lasted from July 1967 to January 1970 and had more than a million deaths. Internationally2, war
appeared as a struggle of Northern Muslims against Christians Ibos of Biafra, but it was not true,
as many Yoruba army officers, as Obasanjo, future President of Nigeria, supported federal troops
against Biafra secession.
The military regime, with a federal structure, of Gowon lasted until 1975, which will be
overthrown by General Murtala Muhammed, who will succeed the general Yoruba Obasanjo
between 1976 and 1979, which will return the power to civilians in the year 1979. In 1978, the
militaries lifted the ban on political parties, which made it to the surface to old leaders who had
survived the political massacres of 1966. The 1979 Constitution is important because it will
change the course of the parliamentary Westminster style form of government to a presidential
2 United Kingdom supported, like most African countries, the maintenance borders of the former
colony, but not France, Tanzania and a few other African countries, taking sides with the
Biafrans. The French case demonstrates the foreign policy of General de Gaulle and his
successors to end the role of the Unite Kingdom in Africa.

regime, strongly influenced by the US Constitution. The regions were called states in the new
Constitution and increased their number of federated states in 7 more new states, which went to
19 and one Federal Capital Territory. The Parliament was bicameral and took the name of
National Assembly. This National Assembly was formed by two chambers: a Senate and a
House of Representatives. The legislatures of the member states had a single chamber: the
Assembly chamber. The Constitution also introduced that, along with English, could be used, but
after a formal agreement, the three main Nigerian languages (article 51). Federal representatives
had a 4 years term. The Federal Electoral Commission divided each member state into 5 districts
for the election of one of the 5 Federal Senators who belonged to each member state, and in 450
constituencies the whole territory of Nigeria for the election of the House of Representatives.
The provisions relating to the Assemblies of the states, one chamber per member state, indicated
that each one should have three times the number of seats in the state Assembly than the number
of Deputies of each state in the federal House of Representatives. In these regional chambers, the
official language was English and any language of the member state where so provided the
Assembly. The mandate of this state chamber was also 4 years term. The Federal Executive was
the Federal President, who also chairs the Government and is Commander in chief of the
Nigerian Armed Forces. The election was done directly by the Nigerian people through general
elections held every 4 years; but he also had to reach the majority of the votes in at least two
thirds of the member states. This Constitution created the post of Vice-President. In the regions,
the Governor was elected by simple majority, at least, a certain percentage in each member
state's local governments. As in the case of the Federal executive, the Constitution also provided
the office of Deputy-Governor.
1866 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
The 1979 general elections were won by the northern candidate Shagari and the National
Party of Nigeria (NPN). Ibos and Yorubas have their own ethnic political parties, those political
bases, as the winner party, were in one of the three former regions. Shagari disastrous and
corrupt government triggered another coup, leaded by General Buhari, which lasted a year in
power, and General Babngida, who was in power between 1985 and 1993 (P.O. Agbese, 1992,
and Larry Diamond, A. Kirk-Green and O. Oyediran, 1997). Both were Muslims. The period
opened by Babangida and his successor, General Abacha (J.O. Ihonvbere, 1998), both also
Muslims, Paul Nugent calls it "the eternal transition period in Nigeria" and "Abachange and
Babangidocracy" (Paul Nugents, 2004: 421). In 1990, the Electoral Commission established that
only two parties could contest next elections: the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the
National Republican Convention (NRC), who gave of their programs or manifestos, resulting in
all respects unthinkable in a modern democracy (A.A. Akinola, 1990). Primaries were
established, which won, against the Government's willingness to SDP presidential candidate,
Yoruba leader, Abiola (A. Awofeso, 1990). The unexpected victory of Abiola made Government
to conclude the elections without finishing the electoral process, because Abiola did not like the
military regime. Abiola supporters began civil disobedience in most South-West and Eastern
states, and Abiola went into exile for two months. The military deposed Babangida and put a
civilian and Yoruba in power, Shonekan. But the real power was held by Defense Minister,
General Abacha. This Interim National Government, that will last, but under the direct command
of Abacha as President, from 1993-1999. During this period Government banned political parties
and Abiola was imprisoned as a traitor. Abacha died in 1998 and took office General Abubakar,
who distanced Abacha regime. During his tenure, Abiola died under mysterious circumstances.
Finally, it was adopted the Constitution of 1999 and general elections were held. During military
1867 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
rule were created new member states, continuing the process of adaptation of new states to areas
dominated by a particular ethnic, religious or linguistic group.
Basically the 1999 Constitution follows the 1979 Constitution (J.O. Ihonvbere, 2000). In
any case, this Constitution deepened into the presidential form of government. Nigeria defines
its shape as a Federal Republic, but, as in other earlier Constitutions, it is defined as an
"indivisible and indissoluble sovereign country", which shows the commitment of the Nigerian
legislators to close up the discussion, which degenerated into civil ethnic riots on the possible
division of the country as it was in its early years as independent nation. It establishes the
existence of 36 member states of the federation, which cites each one of them alphabetically.
Separately refers to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, that replaced Lagos since 1991 as the
capital city of Nigeria. It also was introduced in the Constitution, which is certainly striking, the
number of local government areas, which are 768 in all the whole nation. The powers of the
Federal Republic begin regulating by the federal legislature, called the National Assembly of the
Federation, which continues having two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives.
For the state legislatures prescribe only the existence of a single legislative chamber: the
Chamber State Assembly. The federal and state legislature powers are listed in the Constitution.
The Federal executive powers resides in the President, Vice-President and the Federal Ministers.
The executive of the member states is composed of the state governor, the deputy-governor and
the commissioners of the state governments or state officials serving members. The federal
judiciary is based on federal and state courts3.
3 The courts are the Court or Supreme Court of Nigeria, the Court of Appeal, the High Court of
Appeal, the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja, the Supreme Court of a state,
the Court of Appeal of Sharia of the Capital Territory of Abuja, the state Appeal Court of Sharia,
the Customary Appeal Court of the Federal Capital Territory, the same Courts of the member
states and other lower Courts.

Comoros
The composition of the Senate reduced the number of Federal Senators to 3 of each state
and 1 of the federal capital, Abuja. The House of Representatives is made up of 360 Deputies,
who represent constituencies of similar population, but no constituency can cover more than one
state. Each chamber shall have a president and a deputy-president. In the Senate, the president is
elected from among its members, and a speaker and a deputy-speaker in the lower House also
elected from among its members. The official parliamentary languages are English and Hausa,
Ibo and Yoruba when it is approved by the respective chamber. Federal representatives are
elected for a 4 years term. The age to be Senator is set to 35 years old and that of MPs to 30. For
the election of the representatives of the Federal National Assembly, the Independent National
Electoral Commission shall divide every state of the federation into 3 senatorial districts and the
territory of the federation in 360 electoral districts. The Assembly of each of the 36 states will
consist of 3 or 4 times the number of seats each state has in the House of Representatives; in any
case, it is established that there may be a number less than 24 nor more than 40 members. It will
be chaired by a speaker and a deputy elected from among its members. The districts are based in
single-member constituencies and will be establish by the Independent National Electoral
Commission for a period of 10 years. Each of them should be proportional to the number of their
inhabitants. The President of the Republic is the Head of State, Chief Executive of the Federation
and Commander in Chief of the Nigerian Armed Forces. He must be Nigerian by birth, aged not
less than 40 years, and must have not less than training school certificate or equivalent. Nigerian
electoral body elects the President directly and not, as in the United States, through state
delegates. If two candidates who win the most of the votes and will not achieve less than a
quarter of the votes in at least two thirds of all member states and the Federal Capital Territory.
1869 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
If more than two candidates will win the one with the most votes and win at least one
quarter of the votes in at least two thirds of all states. If none exceed specified, a second election
is held between the most votes nationwide and a second candidate would be one that had
achieved most votes in a larger number of states. The winner will get the majority of the national
vote and at least a quarter of the vote in two-thirds of the states. If no candidate can claim
victory, the Independent National Electoral Commission will raise a third election between the
two most voted candidates. At this time, winning the candidate who obtain the highest number of
votes nationwide. The President only can run once more for a second term, as the President of
the United States4. A governor must be a Nigerian by birth, of at least 35 years and have an
educational level of, at least, school certificate or equivalent. The constituency for governors
elections are set of electors in each state. The conditions for winning are practically the same as
for the case of the Federal Presidential elections, but by calculating the percentages of local state
governments. His term is for 4 years. Beside him, a deputy-governor must be elected. It can only
be re-elected for 2 more terms, making a maximum of 12 years in office possible. The state
government members, named commissioners of the state government, must be ratified by the
state Assembly chamber, as in the case of Federal Ministers. Its regulation is virtually identical
to the Federal Government. Article 297 and following of the first part of the eighth chapter of the

deputy-governor. In both cases, those figures must always accompany the candidate to the
Federal President. The President appoints the Ministers who must be ratified by the Federal
Senate, and must appoint at least one Minister from each one of the 36 Nigerian states, which
must be a citizen of that member state. Ministers can't reconcile his position with that of federal
deputy or senator, in addition to having to meet the conditions laid down in the Constitution to be
a deputy of the House of Representatives. The President may assign his Vice-President or any
Minister responsibility for any matter that he estimates appropriate, including a ministerial
department.

Abuja is the federal capital city and seat of the Federal Government. Prescribing covered
everything regarding the Federal Capital Territory as if it were a federated state. The Federal
Capital Territory elects 1 Senator and members of the House that correspond it according to its
population.
The extensive regulation that makes the Constitution of the Nigerian Armed Forces is
because their important and decisive role in the country political life (P.O. Agbase, 1992).
Within the Nigerian ethnic federalism, the Constitution regulates the body military composition
and other senior officers of the armed forces those reflect the character of Nigeria (Article
217.3). The appointments of senior army, navy and air commander belongs to the Nigerian
President. The National Assembly shall have the power to legislate on the powers of the head of
state as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces and on the appointment, promotion and
discipline of the Armed Forces members. The 1999 Nigerian Constitution also performs an
exhaustive regulation of political parties. It prohibits an association, whatever its name and
function as a party, unless it meets a set of rigid requirements of national official register
Independent National Electoral Commission, that its membership is open to all Nigerians,
regardless of their place of origin, birth, sex, religion or ethnic group membership. The party
names, their symbols or logos, may not contain any ethnic or religious connotation or give the
appearance that its business focuses exclusively on a geographical area of the country. In
addition, the party headquarters must be in the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja. It also
requires that the parties have an democratic internal structure and selection of their leaders. Also
its executive committees should reflect the federal and plural character of Nigeria5.

positions. Also their executive committees should reflect the plural federal character of the
country.

The judiciary consists of a Supreme Court or Federal Court, composed of a maximum of
21 members, whose chairman is appointed by the President, with the recommendation of the
National Judicial Council, and must be ratified by the Senate6. Other courts are federal in nature:
the court of appeals, the federal high court, the high court of the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja,
the appellate court of the Federal Capital Territory, Sharia and Customary Court of Appeal of the
Federal Capital Territory. The state courts are: the High Court or State Court, the Court of
Appeal of a state Sharia and customary appellate court of a state. The State Council is composed
by the Federal President, who presides, the Federal Vice-President, who is its vice-president, all
former Federal Presidents and former Federal Prime-Ministers of Nigeria, all former Presidents
of the Federal Supreme Court, the Senate President, the Speaker of the House of Representatives,
all the States governors of the Federation and the Federal Attorney General. It shall have power
to advise the President in the exercise of his duties with regard to the development of the
population census, the right of pardon, the national honors award, and also on the Independent
National Electoral Commission, including the appointment of its members, and the National
Population Commission, and advise on those matters of public policy of the federation who can
demand the President.
Since 1999, there have been four Presidential elections. They have succeeded in the
presidency three Federal Presidents, one of whom died during his term and he was succeeded by
his vice-president and current federal president. Since 1999, the Popular Democratic Party of
Nigeria (PDP) led by general Obasanjo7, Yaruba, got most of state governments, the majority in
the Senate and in the House of Representatives, and also won the Presidency wit Obasanjo as

approval of the main political actor in Nigeria: the Army.

candidate. The main opposition party is the All Peoples Party of Nigeria (APP), that has its
political base in the Northern states. In the next presidential election, the nominees for the two
major parties were two generals and former Presidents: Obasanjo (PDP) and Buhari (APP).
Obasanjo won again with his vice-president candidate, the Muslim Sehehu Yar'Adua, Katsina
state Governor. Thus, continued the tradition of Nigerian political patronage or "godfatherism",
as noted Adekunle (2011: 95-97), namely that political leaders are placed under the political and
economic protection of a powerful political leader in the state or federal level. Yar'Adua, who
came to the federal presidency in 2007, will die before the end of his first term, so he was
replaced by his vice-president, the Christian Goodluck Ebele Azikiwe Jonathan, which won
again the Presidential elections in 2011 with his party, the PDP.
The Democratic Federal Republic of Ethiopia: A Case of Ethnic Federalism in Africa.
As Hashim Tewfik writes, what characterizes Ethiopia is his great cultural, linguistic and
religious diversity (Hashim Tewfik, 2010: 4). In this country live more than 80 ethnic
communities who speak different languages. Except in a few urban centers, most of these
communities live in their respective geographic areas. None of these groups represents 50
percent of the country's population, although there are relatively large ethnic groups, such as
Amhara and Omoro people. The two country's major religions are Islam and Ethiopian
Christianity. Ethiopia was never colonized by Europeans, although the Italians came to invade
the country, which they called Abyssinia, in the 30 (1936-1941) during the Italian Fascist
political regime of Mussolini. In the late nineteenth century, the Empire Amhara, which is the
second Ethiopian ethnic group in number, expanded north and south of present-day Ethiopia. Its
borders were agreed with the colonial powers in 1896, when Ethiopian troops defeated the
1873 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
Italians at the battle of Adwa. The hegemony of the Amhara Empire, and the imposition of his
language and culture to the other Ethiopian ethnic groups, was completed rapidly during the long
reign of Negast Negus (King of Kings, in Amhara lenguage), Emperor Haile Selassie, who was
on the Ethiopian throne from 1930 to 1974, when he was overthrown by a military coup. The
imperial period of Selassie is seen by Amhara Christians people as a period of splendor, but by
the other ethnic groups, subjected during that time, is considered an historic epoch of Amhara
and Christian colonialism (Tegegne Teka, 1998).
During World War II, Eritrea, an Italian African colony, was occupied by British troops.
After the postwar period, United Nations (UN) tried to give a satisfactory solution to this
territory and the Eritrean people. In 1952, UN became convinced that the best solution to the
Eritrean problem was to join Eritrea to Ethiopia. This solution gave satisfaction to the Ethiopians
desires of having access to the Red Sea, but hardly satisfied the wishes of the Eritrean people of
more freedom and self-government, because their new country, Ethiopia, has a mere formal
democratic Constitution and was ruled by an authoritarian Emperor, Selassie, in a country
without tradition of political decentralization and respect of political and civil rights. Ethiopia is
characterized for being a highly centralized Unitary State, which was not conceived his plural
ethnic, cultural and religious realities. During the early years remained the status of respect for
the constitutional agreements, though, little by little, making power transferred from Eritrea to
Addis Ababa (Nugent, 2004: p. 74). In 1955, the de facto Ethiopian Federation was broken,
which shows the new name given to the autonomous government of Eritrea, which is now called
Regional Government of Eritrea. In 1958, this process was finished with the disappearance of the
Eritrean flag, which will be replaced by the Ethiopian flag, and the beginning of the
Amharazation and the predominance of the Christian Ethiopian church on a predominantly
1874 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
Muslim Eritrean people. In November 1962, the Eritrean Regional Assembly voted, under the
supervision of the Ethiopian army, their integration in Ethiopia, which will end to the federal
experience. In 1962, it started the war in Eritrea, first led by the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF)
and later by the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF). In 1974, a military coup, preceded by
various student and union protests, established the Coordinating Committee of the Armed
Forces, the Police and the Territorial Guard, which is known as the Derg (committee in Amharic
language). After bitter disputes and struggles within the Derg, was imposed as strongman
Mengistu Haile Mariam, who deposed, in September of 1974, the Emperor Selassie and his
dynasty. The Derg nationalized all land and began a radical political reform, also nationalized
banks and private companies, changing the previous Selassie's pro-Western and American
alliance by a new one with the Soviet Union. The "Afro-communist" regime of Mengistu
received military aid during the Ogaden War with Somalia (1977-1978). The adoption of
Marxism-Leninism as an ideology and political organization of the Ethiopian State, reinforced
the previous centralist tendencies in a country deeply pluralistic and diverse. Mengistu continued
war in Eritrea and spread to other regions of the country, as Tigray, where he fought against the
Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), and Oromo, against the Oromo Liberation Front
(OLF). Between 1989 and 1990, the Eritrean EPLF and the Tigray TPLF had important military
advances, which brought down the Derg regime in May 1991.
Between 1991 and 1994, it was established a transitional government until the
constitution of the current Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia (Jhon Abbink, 2011). The
TPLF reached an alliance with other regional and ethnic rebel groups when it sees victory was
achieved. So TPLF joined the Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement (EPDM), the Oromo
People's Democratic Organization (OPDO) and the Southern Ethiopia Peoples Democratic Front
1875 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
(SEPDF) to create the current hegemonic political party in Ethiopia: the Ethiopian People
Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) (Jean-Nicolas Bach, 2011, and Jörg Haustein and
Terje Ostebo, 2011). The EPRDF invited all ethnic opposition parties to a transition conference
in Addis Abbeba, in 1991. This conference, which was joined by about 30 groups and political
parties, adopted a temporary Constitution, called the Fundamental Law, created a Representative
Council of 87 members, and a Transitional Government led by the EPRDF. The Eritrean EPLF
not broke immediately ties with Ethiopia. It decided, in accordance with the new Ethiopian
authorities to hold a referendum of self-determination. After Eritrea achieved its independence,
this new independent African country entered in a new war with Ethiopia, in 1998, for a border
demarcation dispute between the two countries. During the transition period in Ethiopia, it was to
lay the pillars of the Ethiopian ethnic federalism (Kdane Mangisteab, 1997 and 2001). The
Transitional Constitution or Fundamental Law was passed establishing the principle of freedom,
equal rights and self-determination of all Ethiopian communities or ethnic groups as a main
principle of government, which guaranteed each nation or Ethiopian people their right to
segregate of Ethiopia and creates a new independent country. It also established federal levels of
government during the transition period. Therefore, the devolution of powers period, referred by
Tewfik (2010), was initiated during the political transition from Dreg to the Democratic Federal
Republic of Ethiopia. The Transition Charter also stipulated that the Head of State, the Prime-
Minister, the Vice-Chairperson and Secretary of the Council of Representatives shall be from
different nations or nationalities, as prescribe article 9b. The 87 member Council of
Representatives (COR), comprising "representatives of national liberation movements, other
political organizations and prominent individuals" (article 7). The COR acted as the national
parliament for the two-and- half-year transitional period. EPRDF had the largest voting bloc with
1876 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
32 seats, followed by the Oromo Liberation front (OLF) with 12 seats. The radical departure
from the unitary policies of the two previous political regimes provoked immediate opposition
from pan-Ethiopian nationalists.
In December 1994, the Constitutional Assembly approved the new Ethiopian
Constitution that's characterized by its federalism, its commitment to participatory democracy
and human rights. The 1995 Ethiopian Federal Constitution recognizes and institutionalizes the
right of the ethno-linguistic communities of Ethiopia to self-determination. What makes the
Constitution is a recognition of the constitutional provisions contained in the interim Constitution
(Fundamental Law). Nations, nationalities, peoples and ethno-linguistic communities, which in
all these ways the Constitution refers to the subject of the right of self-determination, have the
unconditional right to self-determination, as required by article 39, including the right to
secession. The structure of the Ethiopian State is divided between Federal and Regional or
member-states Institutions. Ethiopian ethnic federalism, in each of the two entities, the federal
and federated states, has assigned legislative, executive and judicial powers in their respective
fields of constitutionally defined autonomy. The Federation powers are contained in articles 51
and 55 of the Constitution, and for the states-members are include all matters not specifically
assigned or concurrently to the Federation. The Constitution recognizes the existence of 9
regional or members states: Tigray, Afar, Amhara, Oromiya, Somali, Benishangul-Gumuz,
Southern Nations, Gambella and Harar, with Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa as federally
administered States-Cities.
The Ethiopian Constitution affirmed the unrestricted right of all ethnic groups to self-
determination up to secession, when the large article 39 says: “Every nation, nationality and
people shall have the unrestricted right to self- determination up to secession”. The act of
1877 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
secession requires a two-thirds of the vote in the legislature of the seceding ethnic group to be
followed three years later by a referendum in the seceding region. It does not require the
approval of the federal legislature. This right to self-determination and secession of every nation,
nationality and people of Ethiopia is included in Part Two, named Democratic Rights, of Chapter
Three, that regulated The Fundamental Rights and Freedoms, after the article 38, that regulated
the right to vote and to be elected, and before article 40, that regulated the right to property. This
article 39 recognizes three subjects who can exercise the "right to self-determination, including
secession: every Nation, Nationality and People of the country. They have "an unconditional
right to self-determination, including the right to secession". For the purpose of this Constitution,
as article 39.5, says, "a Nation, Nationality or People (...) is a group of people who have or share
large measure of a common culture or similar customs, mutual intelligibility of language, belief
in a common or related identities, a common psychological make-up, and who inhabit an
identifiable, predominantly contiguous territory". The self-determination process shall come into
effect, as article 39 prescribes, when a demand for secession has been approved by a two-thirds
majority of the members of the Legislative Council of the Nation, Nationality or People
concerned, as I have said before; when the Federal Government has organized a referendum
which must take place within 3 years from the time it received the concerned Council’s decision
for secession; when the demand for secession is supported by majority vote in the referendum;
when the Federal Government will have transferred its powers to the Council or regional
legislature of the Nation, Nationality or People who has voted to secede; and when the division
of assets is effected in a manner prescribed by a federal law.
The House of Federation (the Upper House) is the guardian and interpreter of the Federal
Constitution. It is the chamber in which “nations, nationalities, and peoples” are directly and
1878 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
proportionately represented. The House is composed of at least one representative from each of
the 67 ethnic groups in the country, and one additional representative for every one million
population of each ethnic group. The Federal Constitution provides important executive,
legislative and judicial authority to regional states. As I said before, the Constitution prescribes
“All powers not given expressly to the Federal Government alone, or concurrently to the Federal
government and the States are reserved to the States” (article 52). Article 39 recognizes the right
of every Nation, Nationality and People in Ethiopia to speak, to write and to develop its own
language; to express, to develop and to promote its culture; and to preserve its history. Every
Nation, Nationality and People in Ethiopia has the right to a full measure of self-government
which includes the right to establish institutions of government in the territory that it inhabits and
to equitable representation in state and Federal governments. In the Chapter Fore of the
Ethiopian Constitution is regulated the State Structure. Article 46 mandates that "States shall be
delimited on the basis of the settlement patterns, language, identity and consent of the peoples
concerned". The Ethnic Ethiopian Federalism allows every Nations, Nationalities and Peoples
within the States, those have been enumerated in article 47.1, that is, the States of Tigray, Afar,
Amhara, Oromia, Somalia, Benshangul/Gumuz, the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples,
Gambela Peoples and Gambari People, to have the right to establish, at any time, their own
States. This right of any Nation, Nationality or People to form its own state is exercisable under
the following procedures: when the demand for statehood has been approved by a two-thirds
majority of the members of the Council of the Nation, Nationality or People concerned, and the
demand is presented in writing to the State Council; when the Council that received the demand
has organized a referendum within one year to be held in the Nation, Nationality or People that
made the demand; when the demand for statehood is supported by a majority vote in the
1879 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
referendum; when the State Council will have transferred its powers to the Nation, Nationality or
People that made the demand; and when the new State created by the referendum without any
need for application, directly becomes a member of the Federal Democratic Republic of
Ethiopia. The Federal Constitution observes that all the member States of the Federal Democratic
Republic of Ethiopia shall have equal rights and powers. Article 49 establishes "Addis Ababa
shall be the capital city of the Federal State". The residents of Addis Ababa shall have a full
measure of self-government. Particulars shall be determined by law. The Administration of
Addis Ababa shall be responsible to the Federal Government. Residents of Addis Ababa shall in
accordance with the provisions of this Constitution, be represented in the House of Peoples’
Representatives. The special interest of the State of Oromia in Addis Ababa, regarding the
provision of social services or the utilization of natural resources and other similar matters, as
well as joint administrative matters arising from the location of Addis Ababa within the State of
Oromia, shall be respected. Particulars shall be determined by law.
Each of the 9 regions has its own Constitution, flag, government, legislature, and
judiciary Institutions. It chooses its own working or official language, and as I said, they have the
right to secession. The Constitution also allows further decentralization from regional State to
zonal and woreda (district in Amharic language) levels. Some constituent parts (for instance,
ethnic areas) want their statuses upgraded to that of regional state, primarily because that is
where executive power lies. The Constitution provides little guidance to the federal-regional
relations. Dealing with inter-state border disputes, article 48 stipulates settlement by bilateral
agreement among the disputant region-states. All State border disputes shall be settled by
agreement of the concerned States. Where the concerned States fail to reach agreement, the
House of the Federation shall decide such disputes on the basis of settlement patterns and the
1880 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
wishes of the peoples concerned. The House of Federation shall, within a period of 2 years,
render a final decision on a dispute submitted fallowing the before explained method. Article 50
only stipulates the general need for mutual, reciprocal respect between federal and regional
governments. The Federal Government mediates among regional states in case of controversy.
Relations between the Federal Government and regional governments and among regional
governments have been relatively smooth, because the hegemonic party, albeit, as I said before, a
multiethnic coalition, and dominates almost all levels of government directly or indirectly
through its allied ethnic parties. The ruling coalition, EPRDF, enjoys a monopoly of power at all
almost all levels of government. Despite the solemn declaration that all unspecified powers to the
Federation correspond to the regions, they remain weak.
Article 50 says that the Federation and the States shall have legislative, executive and
judicial powers. The House of Peoples' Representatives is the highest authority of the Federal
Government. The House is responsible to the People. The State Council is the highest organ of
State authority. It is responsible to the People of the State. Chapter Six of the Ethiopian
Constitution regulates the Federal Houses. Members of the House of Peoples' Representatives
shall be elected by the People for a 5 years term by direct and universal suffrage in free and fair
elections held by secret ballot. Members of the House shall be elected from candidates in each
electoral district by a plurality of the votes cast. Provisions shall be made by law for special
representation for minority Nationalities and Peoples. Members of the House, on the basis of
population and special representation of minority Nationalities and Peoples, shall not exceed
550; of these, minority Nationalities and Peoples shall have at least 20 seats. Particulars shall be
determined by law. The House of Peoples’ Representatives shall have the power of legislation in
all matters assigned by the Constitution to Federal jurisdiction. It shall ratify international
1881 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
agreements concluded by the executive, approve the appointment of Federal judges, members of
the Council of Ministers, commissioners, the Auditor General, and of other officials whose
appointment is required by law to be approved by it. It also shall establish a Human Rights
Commission and determine by law its powers and functions, establish the institution of the
Ombudsman, select and appoint its members, and determine by law the powers and functions of
the institution. It shall, on its own initiative, request a joint session of the House of the Federation
and of the House of Peoples’ Representatives to take appropriate measures when State
authorities are unable to arrest violations of human rights within their jurisdiction. It shall, on the
basis of the joint decision of the House, give directives to the concerned State authorities. It has
the power to call and to question the Prime Minister and other Federal officials and to investigate
the Executive’s conduct and discharge of its responsibilities. It shall, at the request of one-third
of its members, discuss any matter pertaining to the powers of the executive. It has, in such
cases, the power to take decisions or measures it deems necessary. It shall elect the Speaker and
Deputy Speaker of the House.
With the consent of the House, the Prime Minister may cause the dissolution of the House
before the expiry of its term in order to hold new elections. The President may invite political
parties to form a coalition government within one week, if the Council of Ministers of a previous
coalition is dissolved because of the loss of its majority in the House. The House shall be
dissolved and new elections shall be held if the political parties cannot agree to the continuation
of the previous coalition or to form a new majority coalition. If the House is dissolved pursuant
to sub-Article 1 or 2 of this Article, new elections shall be held within six months of its
dissolution. The new House shall convene within thirty days of the conclusion of the elections.
Following the dissolution of the House, the previous governing party of coalition of parties shall
1882 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
continue as a caretaker government. Beyond conducting the day to day affairs of government and
organizing new elections, it may not enact new proclamations, regulations or decrees, nor may it
repeal or amend any existing law.
The House of the Federation is composed of representatives of Nations, Nationalities and
Peoples. Each Nation, Nationality and People shall be represented in the House of the Federation
by at least 1 member, and by 1 additional representative for each one million of its population.
Members of the House of the Federation shall be elected by the State Councils. The State
Councils may themselves elect representatives to the House of the Federation, or they may hold
elections to have the representatives elected by the people directly. Article 62 regulates the
Powers and Functions of the House of the Federation. The House has the power to interpret the
Constitution, as I said before. It shall organize the Council of Constitutional Inquiry, and in
accordance with the Constitution, decide on issues relating to the rights of Nations, Nationalities
and Peoples to self-determination, including the right to secession, as we saw before. 4. It shall
promote the equality of the Peoples of Ethiopia enshrined in the Constitution and promote and
consolidate their unity based on their mutual consent. It shall exercise the powers concurrently
entrusted to it and to the House of Peoples’ Representative. It shall strive to find solutions to
disputes or misunderstandings that may arise between States, determine the division of revenues
derived from joint Federal and State tax sources and the subsidies that the Federal Government
may provide to the States. It shall determine civil matters which require the enactment of laws by
the House of Peoples’ Representatives. Finally, it shall order Federal intervention if any State, in
violation of this Constitution, endangers the constitutional order. It shall elect the Speaker and
the Deputy Speaker of the House, and it shall adopt rules of procedure and internal
administration. The Speaker of the House of the Federation shall preside over the meetings of the
1883 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
House. He shall, on behalf of the House, direct all its administrative affairs and enforce all

the House of Peoples' Representatives. No one may be a member of the House of Peoples'
Representatives and of the House of the Federation simultaneously.
Articles 69 to 71 refer to the figure of the Head of State: the President of the Federal
Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. The House of Peoples' Representatives shall nominate the
candidate for President. The nominee shall be elected President if a joint session of this House
and the House of the Federation approves his candidacy by a two-thirds majority vote. A
member of either House shall vacate his seat if elected President. The term of office of the

the Prime Minister and in accordance with law, grant high military titles, and, in accordance with
conditions and procedures established by law, grant pardon.
Articles 72 to 77 regulates the Government and the Prime-Minister. Article 73 says that
the highest executive powers of the Federal Government are vested in the Prime Minister and in
the Council of Ministers. The Prime-Minister and the Council of Ministers are responsible to the
House of Peoples' Representatives, as in a parliamentary form of government. In the exercise of
1884 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the

Constitutional Inquiry have powers to investigate constitutional disputes. Should the Council,
upon consideration of the matter, find it necessary to interpret the Constitution, it shall submit its
recommendations thereon to the House of the Federation. Where any Federal or State law is

The first President of the Democratic Federal Republic of Ethiopia was Negaso Gidado,
and the first Prime-Minister and strong man, the Tigray, Meles Zenawi. The Federal Parliament
is bicameral, which make up the House of People's representatives and the House of the
Federation. The House of the Federation equates to the second territorial Chamber or Senate in
other federal countries, as in United States or Nigeria. It Is the Chamber of nations, nationalities
and peoples that make up Ethiopia. Its aim is to maintain consensus and agreement among them.
Its most important mission is to interpret the Constitution and resolve all constitutional disputes.
The federal executive is composed of the Head of State or President and the Government and the
Prime-Minister. The Constitution states that the political party or coalition that has a majority in
the House of Representatives of the People will assume the Government. The Prime-Minister
1889 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
must be a member of this Chamber. The real operation of the Ethiopian political system is
subjected to the political hegemony of the EPRDF, in power since 1991, and under the
leadership of the minority Tigray ethnic group (Berhanu G. Bacha, 2009). As we saw, this
political party was the result of the strategy of alliances with other regional formations to
conform a multi-ethnic political party in Ethiopia of EPRDF. This political structure is
maintained and creates a parallel power structure that tempers the development with all the
consequences of an authentic political decentralization as it was designed in the Ethiopian
Federal Constitution. Its consequence makes Ethiopia a formal Federal State, with little real
political weight of the federated or regional entities (John Ishiyama, 2010).
Federalism in a microsate: the case of the Union of the Comoros.
The Comoro Islands are an homogeneous county in terms of religion, ethnic, linguistic
and colonial French historical past. Comoros have a rich independent history in a small islands
micro-state. A country that has changed its Constitution. A nation who leaved the Unitary and
uniform constitutional structure of the first years of its Independence to a federal and
decentralised political organization, that was the political product of international and national
agreements among the Comoro political parties and islands political leaders under the patronage
and surveillance of African Union. And it seems to work out well, by the moment and among
many problems. The Union of the Comoros hasn't ethnic, religious or linguistic cleavages who
had divided the Comorian society, as in Nigeria and Ethiopia. It has been the Ocean who has
divided this country. It has been Geography. It has been the mistrust among the three islands who
conform the Union of the Comoros, or may be it has been its political elite, because its
1890 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
incapability and incompetence of the leaders of the three islands to share power and to build a
national spirit of being citizens of the same country (J.A. Garcia-Rojas, 2011).
The Union of the Comoros is the third smallest African country. Its population is 691.400
inhabitants. The majority of its inhabitants live in the two major islands and only a few live in
the smallest one. The capital city is Moroni. Moroni is in the largest and most populated island,
Grande Comore (Ngazidja, in Comorian language), the other largest and most populated island is
Anjouan (Nzwani), and the smallest one is Moheli (Mwali). The Union of the Comoros (Udzima
wa Komori, in Comorian Swahili language) is a Muslim country. The almost 100 per cent of its
population practice the Sunni Islam religion. The fourth island of the Comoro archipelago is
Mayotte. Mayotte was the first island colonized by the Frenchs and his capital city was the first
Comorian capital under the French colonization. Moroni was elected capital of the Territoire de
Outr-Mer (TOM in French) (Territorial Oversees Local Government) of Comoro Islands only a
few years before the independence of the new nation by the first native elected local council.
This decision was rejected by the majority of the Mayotte population and it was one of the
causes, among others, of the non pro-independence majority vote of the people of Mayotte in the
Independence plebiscite of 1975.
The Union of the Comoros Constitution recognizes three languages as official: Arab,
French and Comorian. This language is mixed of Swahili and Arabic and has some dialectal
forms in each island. In Mayotte, a French department de outré-mer (oversees province), the
unique official language is French. As I said before, the people of the Union of the Comoros is
predominantly homogeneous and it is the product of the successive arrivals of diverse groups
from the Eastern African Coast, the Persian Gulf, the Malay Archipelago and from Madagascar.
The Arab ancestors arrived to the Islands later and they came from Yemen and Oman in the
1891 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
Arabian peninsula. These Arabs settlers brought with the Islamic religion, the oldest and most
powerful Comorian families boast about their Arab origins. The first Europeans who arrived to
Comoro Islands was the Portuguese, and later the Dutch, but the Omani expelled the first
European settlers and then diverse and rivals Comoro Sultans dominated the Comoro Islands
since the French conquer and political domination. The French Empire landed in Mayotte and
signed a treaty with its Malagasy king of the island in 1841, which ceded the island of Mayotte
to the French authorities. In 1866, the small island of Moheli and Grande Comore accepted
French protection, but in this case, the Sultan of Grande Comore kept some kind of sovereignty
until 1909. Anjouan was the latest islands to join the French Empire. It happened in 1909. In that
year the Anjouan Sultan abdicated in favour of the French authorities. As we can see, Mayotte is
the island with strongest ties with France, and it is also the island with a different group of
inhabitants. All these specifics characteristics explain the rejection of being a part of a free and
independent country in the plebiscite of 1975. Comoro Islands reached its Independence by a
plebiscite, celebrated in each of the four islands of the archipelago, in 1975. Before its
Independence, and in the historical context of the beginning of the fifth Republic, they had a
limited self local government through the administrative formula of the TOMs (Territoire
Français d’Outré-mer) (French Ovearsees Territory). During those years before the
Independence of France, Comoros has a two party system. These two parties represented the
traditional island elites. The Comoro History since its Independence is one of the most unlucky
and unstable one of the African Continent, because this small country has suffered many coups
d’etat, mercenary military intervention, the most of them commanded by the famous former
French legionary Bob Denard, and secessionist attempts of some islands with the goal of being a
new island country separated of the other two islands, and, over all, of the capital island of
1892 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
Grande Comore. The most separatist island has been Anjouan, but Moheli have also claimed in
the 90s for independence. Comoro has suffered 20 coups or attempted coups since its
Independence of France (Jose Adrian Garcia-Rojas, 2012: 175).
In 1975, newly reached the independence, it was done the first coup d'état, and then took
power Alis Solilih, who implanted a revolutionary political regime strongly influenced by the
one party Arab nationalist regimes. This President remained in power three years until he was
removed by a military coup done by the same mercenaries which have helped to win power in
1975. He was murdered by the mercenary troops. His successor was the first President of the
Republic, Abdalah Abderramane. He established a new Constitution that defined Comoro Islands
as a Federal Islamic Republic (Jean-Paul Negrin, 1980, and Michel Pineau and Lucien Audibert,
1984-1985). But he did not respect his own Constitution and he never implemented federalism
and a multi-party system. He ruled the country as a one party state with no respect of civil rights.
Abderramane returned to a pro-France foreign policy, but with the constant claim of Mayotte as
a mere justification of the total dependence of the French economic and military aide. In 1989,
President Abdalah Abderramene was murdered for revel troops commanded by mercenaries in
the Presidential residence. These mercenaries took power for a few months since French troops
restored the Comorian power in the figure of the President of the Constitutional Court, Mohamed
Säid Djohar, as interim President of the Republic. This interim President called for free elections
and he was the winning candidate in these general elections. His candidature were not accepted
by some opposition groups. During his presidency and the presidency of his successors, the
Comoro Islands had some military and separatist attempts. In 1999, colonel Azali seized power
in a bloodless coup that deposed the interim President Massounde. Azali failed to re-established
control over the separatist islands those remained revels to the central government of Azali in
1893 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the

Moroni. Anjouan and Moheli declared their Independence in 1997 and remained in a revel
position, because the Comorian Army was unable to control these two islands. The Azali coup
was criticized for the international community, the French Government and the African Union
(AU). With the mediation of the AU, under the leadership of South Africa President Mbeki, it
was negotiated with political delegates of the three islands the basis of the new Federal
Constitution. This Constitution has remained in a very unstable milieu since 2002. In this year
was elected for the first time by the peculiar rotating system of presidential candidate primaries,
the first presidential candidates in their home island of Grande Comore, and later the whole
Comoro electorate voted Azali as new President of the Union of the Comoros, the new name
done by the federal Constitution. Four years after, in 2006, the same process were implemented
in Anjouan to choose the candidates for the Presidency who have to be voted for the whole
people of the Union in a second round. The cleric Ahmed Abdallah Sambi ruled the country for 4
years as the Constitution prescribes. The last election begun in Moheli to choose the presidential
candidates to be voted for all the Comorian electorate in the second round. These presidential
elections suffered some delay because the interferences of the federal President, Sambi, and the
President of the island-state or island-region of Moheli. The official candidate (the mohelian
Sambi’s candidate and his former Vice-President), Ikililou Dhoinine, won in this last presidential
election and he is the first President of the Union of Comoros who was born in Moheli, because
the other Comoro Presidents were native of Anjouan, the most of them, and Grande Comore.
Comoro Islands as an Independent nation has had different Constitutions. The late
Constitution was approved by the Comorian people in the plebiscite of 2001. The Union of the
Comoros is one of the few federal countries in Africa. As I said before, this Constitution was not
the first federal Constitution of the Comoro Islands, but it was the first one who has remained
1894 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
more than a few years and who has implemented some islands-states institutions and powers.
The reason is that the federal idea was one of the solutions adopted by the island delegates who
signed the political agreements those lead to the Constitution of 2001 and its political
institutions. The type of its political system is a presidential Islamic federal Republic. The Union
of the Comoros is a presidential regime. As a part of the federal agreement to resolve the
separatist movements in two of the three islands, they adopted a very singular presidential
electoral system. This system consists in two electoral processes. The first electoral process is
based in a primary elections of presidential candidates. This election must celebrate in one of the
three islands each four years. It begun in Grande Comore, in 2002, and continued in Anjuan, in
2006, and the last one was in Moheli in 2010. Then, the next presidential first round will be in
Grande Comore and so on. The second round is the general presidential elections among the
candidate chosen in the primary in an island, but in this case for the whole electorate of the three
islands. With this rotating primary selection of presidential candidates, the Constitution tray to
resolve the old problem of distrust between the three islands and it tries to guarantee the
possibility of a Presidency who represented the people of each island through the participation in
the selection of the presidential candidates each four years and in the conscience of the
possibility of having a President native of each island who guarantee the peculiar island interest
and a proportional distribution of the poor revenues of the federal government among the three
islands. This peculiar electoral presidential system is reinforced by the election in the same ticket
of the two vice-Presidents, who must have been born in the other two islands. The President can
be elected for a second term but in this case he must be elected as a presidential candidate in the
primary election that must celebrate in a different island than his native island (Jose Adrian
Garcia-Rojas, 2011: 404-408).
1895 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
The legislative is unicameral, despite its federal form of government. This is quite strange
in a federal political system. In Germany, United States, or in Nigeria or in Ethiopia, as we have
seen before, and in other federal or formal federal countries, generally they have two chambers
or Houses, one who represents the country people as a whole, and the upper chamber that
represented the territories. But Comoro Islands only has one chamber: the National Assembly.
The representative mandate is 5 years term, but the President could call for new elections before
these five years. In this case the President could dissolve the electoral mandate. This
constitutional instrument is strange in a presidential regime (it does not exist in United State, for
instance), and it is characteristic of the parliamentary regimes, as in United Kingdom or Spain.
The number of National Assembly members is 33. 18 parliamentary members are elected in
electoral districts by a majority system of two rounds, and the other 15 are elected by each Island
Assembly (5 for each Island Assembly). These 15 parliamentary members represent the island
interests in the National Assembly and it is the way the Constitution took to make islands
participate in the elaboration of the federal laws and in the distribution of the federal budget
between the islands. These parliamentary members represent the territories with the same
number of members. It seems as a mixture of the US Senate (the same number of members for
each state in the upper chamber) and the German Rathaus (in the German upper chamber, the
Council, each state is represented by members chosen by the regional government) or the
Spanish Senate (a part of the Spanish Senators are elected by the regional parliaments). The
Union of the Comoros has a Constitutional Court to resolve the controversies about the
constitutionality of the federal and regional laws and the conflicts among the island-regions and
the Union (federation). It also has a Supreme Court for the judicial affairs. In the election of the
members of the Constitutional Court participates the Island regional Assemblies.
1896 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
The Union of the Comoro Constitution is brief, though it is a new Constitution of a
federal State. It only contains 40 articles. In spite of all the Constitution of the Union of Comoros
establishes some constitutional mechanisms to make possible the political participation of each
island in the federal political decision making process. As I have said before, the Constitution
establishes the way each island Assemblies elects 5 members (a total of 15) to the National
Assembly. Likewise the islands participate in the national presidential elections through the
peculiar two round system. First, choosing the presidential candidates by a primary system in one
of the three islands by a rotating system. At the same time, the Ministers of the National Cabinet
must be selected in a proportional way by the federal President in order to keep some balance
among the three islands. And also the institutional charges must be elected in a similar way to
keep that balance between the three islands in all the Federal Institutions. For instance, the article
32 of the Constitution expresses that the President and the Vice-presidents of the Union, the
President of the National Assembly and the three Island Presidents will elect one Judge of the
Constitutional Court. As many federal countries, the Union of the Comoros Constitution
considers the states or regions, in this case islands, participation in the constitutional reform
process. The article 37 of the Union Constitution establishes that the initiative in the
constitutional reform process belongs to the President of the Union, the two third of the National
Assembly members or the same number of members of the Island Assemblies or by direct vote
of the people of Comoros. The Constitution also says that no Constitutional reform can affect the
territorial unity of the country nor its international borders nor the islands political autonomy and
self-government. Finally the Constitution establishes that each of the three islands will approve
their respective Fundamental Law (Island or regional Constitution or Statue of Autonomy), and
1897 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
also foresees the eventuality reunification of the island of Mayotte in the Union (Säid Mohamed
Säid Hassane, 2005: 444-447).
The Fundamental Laws of Anjouan, Moheli and Grande Comore have a similar number
of articles (61, 65 and 71 articles respectively). The Fundamental Laws were elaborated in 2002,
one year after the sign of the Flamboni agreements (2001). The institutional organization of the
three Fundamental Laws is practically the same, because the Constitution mentions that each
island-state must have an elective executive and legislative. The judicial institution (an islands
supreme court) was regulated in all the three Fundamental Laws. The Island Presidents must be
elected via run-off voting to ensure that the Presidents always are elected by the majority vote. If
no candidate obtains this majority at the first round, the two of them who had casted the higher
scores are selected to compete in a second round. In all the three cases, the respective
Fundamental Laws establish that the different candidates must be native or residents of the
respective islands. The three Island Presidents are elected for 5 years. The Island Presidents
nominate the Ministers. The number of Island Ministers varies between 5, in the case of the
smallest island, Moheli, and 10, in the case of Anjouan. The type of island-state form of
governments is a mixture between the French semi-presidential and the presidential political
systems, because in some cases, as in Anjouan, the Island Government can call for a confidence
motion about its performance, but in the other two islands, Moheli and Grande Comore, the type
of regime is typically presidential, because the respective Fundamental Laws don’t establish any
parliamentary mechanism like the vote of confidence or the censure motion (Jose Adrian Garcia-
Rojas: 417-421).
The name of the Island legislative Chambers is the Island Assembly. The number of their
members varies between 10 in Moheli, and 25 in Anjouan. Their electoral mandates are 4 years,
1898 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
1 year less than the presidential mandates. The Island Assembly members are elected in a single-
member constituency through a two-round system. Each Assembly member must know the three
official national languages (French, Arab and Comorian or Swahili Comorian). The three
Fundamental Laws regulate the ways the Island Assemblies approve their laws. These laws can't
exceed the federal Constitution or the National Assembly competences to legislate. The three
Fundamental Laws regulate the same number of consultative chambers and in a similar way.
They regulate an Economic and Social Council and an Ulama or Ulema Council. In this last case
the spirituals o religious leaders in each island are members of the Ulama Island Council. In the
Fundamental Laws of Moheli and Grande Comore are regulated a third consultative council: a
Council of the Island Diaspora. These consultative councils give their political institutions advice
in economic, political, moral, religious or migration political problems. The amendment
processes of the Fundamental Laws are regulated in a similar way in the three cases. In Moheli
and Grande Comore the initiative to change the Fundamental Law is in the hands of the Island
President and half of the legal number of the Island Assembly members. The amendments must
be voted by the majority of the chamber and afterwards this reform must be voted by the people
of the island in a referendum. In Anjouan vary the number of Assembly members who it is
necessary to propose and approve the reform, because it is of the two third of the Assembly
members. In this last case is also necessary the people’s vote in a plebiscite for the final approve
of the Fundamental Law amendment.
Some prelimnary conclusions.
First, the three African Federal countries have different territorial extension, number of
inhabitants, past colonial inheritances, and they also have a different geostrategic position.
1899 Jose Adrian Garcia-RojasA comparative perspective of three African Federal Systems: the cases of Nigeria, Ethiopia and the Union of the
Comoros
Second, in all the three cases, they share some past federal political experiences those badly
ended, one in Comoro Islands and Ethiopia, but, in the case of Nigeria, it hasn't interrupted
federalism since its independence.
Third, two countries, Ethiopia and Nigeria, shares quite diverse ethnic and religious
societies those speak different languages and prey to different gods; but, in the Union of the
Comoros, the cause of communal division of their society is purely geographical, it is due to its
island setting, because its people speak the same languages and professing the same religion:
Islam.
Fourth, they share a common history of communal violence and civil ethnic wars
(Ethiopia and Nigeria), which has left a mark on their Federal and Regional Political Institutions
and on their constitutional engineering mechanisms those try to balance the various ethnic,
religious or territorial groups into the federal Institutions and their decision-making process, with
a theoretical or formal wide political decentralization and self-government, that was guaranteed
in their respective Federal Constitutions, despite they also have other institutions to maintain
national unity in their divided societies.
Fifth, those Institutions are the real power behind the curtain: the army, in Nigeria, the dominant
political party, in Ethiopia, and the ambiguous negotiation between local elites, especially, of
Grande Comore and Anjouan islands, to respect and ensure the rotation among members of these
island elites in the Comoro federal institutions.
